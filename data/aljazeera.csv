3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/26/macron-to-visit-china-seek-xis-help-to-end-russia-ukraine-war,"French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will visit China in April to seek the Chinese government’s help with ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The announcement on Saturday came after China published a 12-point position paper that called for a ceasefire and a “political settlement” to end the year-long conflict.Macron, speaking on the sidelines of an agricultural show in Paris, said he would visit China in “early April”.“The fact that China is engaging in peace efforts is a good thing,” the French leader said, stressing that peace was only possible if “Russian aggression was halted, troops withdrawn, and the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its people was respected”.“China must help us put pressure on Russia so that it never uses chemical or nuclear weapons … and that it stops its aggression as a precondition for talks,” he added.Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral party on the conflict, even as it has maintained close ties with Russia and helped scuttle a joint statement condemning the war at a G20 gathering in India.The Chinese position paper, published on the anniversary of the conflict, said war benefits no one and urged all parties to “support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible”.Released by the foreign ministry, the plan urges an end to Western sanctions against Russia, the establishment of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and steps to ensure the export of grain after disruptions caused global food prices to spike last year.It also made clear its opposition to the use and threat of deploying nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use Moscow’s atomic arsenal in the conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed China’s efforts on Friday, saying Kyiv needed to cooperate with Beijing to put an end to the war.“China started talking about Ukraine, and that’s not bad,” Zelenskyy said. “It seems to me that there is respect for our territorial integrity, security issues.”“We need to work with China on this point. … Our task is to unite everyone in order to isolate one,” he added.The Ukrainian leader also expressed hopes to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, calling it “important for world security”.But some of Ukraine’s allies have expressed scepticism at China’s commitment to brokering peace, nodding to Beijing’s close ties to Moscow.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said China was not well placed to negotiate an end to the war. “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine,” he told reporters, adding that Beijing had signed an agreement with Putin days before the invasion, pledging a “no limits” partnership.The United States has also said China was “considering providing lethal support” to Russia, a claim that Beijing has denied.Analysts in China meanwhile say Beijing’s refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes it “the only honest broker who can help resolve the conflict”.“China as one of the largest economies in the world certainly benefits from an end to hostilities,” said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization think tank.“From a reputation prestige perspective, playing a role in bringing this conflict to a close when no other major power has been able to do so would burnish China’s reputation,” he told Al Jazeera. “But we have to recognise that there’s only so much that an honest broker can do and sometimes, both sides have to fight to a certain amount of exhaustion before there can be a negotiated settlement and whether we are at this point or not, remains to be seen.”Macron’s announcement of his Beijing visit came shortly after the Chinese foreign ministry said Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko would pay a state visit from February 28 to March 2 at Xi’s invitation.A longtime ally of Putin, Lukashenko is beholden to the Russian president for shoring him up in 2020 after mass protests broke out against a presidential election that the Belarus opposition and Western governments said had been rigged.Lukashenko has denied the claims and accused the West of funding protesters. He has supported Putin in his year-long war with Ukraine, including by letting him invade from Belarusian territory and by allowing Russia to train newly mobilised troops in Belarus.Ukraine has expressed concerns that Belarus could again support Moscow in its war effort, with the countries announcing the creation of a joint regional force last October.The Chinese government, in a statement, said Foreign Minister Qin Gang told his Belarusian counterpart Sergei Aleinik in a phone call on Friday that Beijing was willing to work with Minsk to deepen mutual political trust.China would also continue to support Belarus in maintaining national stability and oppose attempts by “external forces” to interfere in its internal affairs or impose “illegal” unilateral sanctions on Minsk, Qin told Aleinik.",0.06972,0.35659,5037,9,6,11,4,2

Some waved Russian flags.Wagenknecht accused the German government of seeking to “ruin Russia,” and said that Moscow should be made an “offer” in order to resume peace talks.Another of the organisers, prominent feminist author Alice Schwarzer, said it was time to look beyond left and right.The two women have also launched a petition which claims to have gathered more than 645,000 signatures.A woman takes part in a protest against the delivery of weapons to Ukraine and in support of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Berlin, Germany [Christian Mang/Reuters]Protesters jeered whenever she and Wagenknecht mentioned the name of German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who has strongly backed the delivery of arms to Ukraine.Police said that about 13,000 people took part in the rally at Berlin’s iconic Brandenburg Gate, while organisers claimed that 50,000 people participated.One attendee was Konstantin Schneider, an academic from Berlin, who said he understood that countries in Eastern Europe were afraid of Russia.“Of course [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is an idiot to attack Ukraine,” he said. “But we still need to find new solutions [to the war] instead of sweepingly saying there’s nothing to negotiate.”There were several small counter-demonstrations. On Friday, thousands of protesters across Europe marched against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.In Paris, several hundred people sang on Saturday Ukraine’s national anthem at Place de la Republique before Ukrainian children dressed in traditional costume led a procession.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a recent television interview that he does not see a prospect for peace talks at present.“We need to understand that the Russian president currently accepts only one form of negotiations, which is that [Ukraine] capitulates unconditionally and he achieves all of his aims,” Scholz told public broadcaster ZDF.People take part in a protest against the delivery of weapons to Ukraine in Berlin, Germany [Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters]Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05854,0.35858,3666,11,3,9,1,0

The G20, formed more than 20 years ago to tackle economic crises, has increasingly struggled to reach the consensus needed to issue an official end-of-meeting communique.“Although there was not what we would call a communique, but only an outcome statement, we still think we’ve made some progress in having all the ministers on board,” Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.German finance minister Christian Lindner said China’s refusal to join the declaration was “regrettable”.US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen earlier said that it was “absolutely necessary” for any statement to condemn Russia. Two delegates told Reuters that Russia and China did not want the G20 platform to be used to discuss political matters.Russia, a member of the G20 but not of the G7, has referred to its actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation”, and avoids calling it an invasion or war.India has kept a largely neutral stance, declining to blame Russia for the invasion, seeking a diplomatic solution and sharply boosting its purchases of Russian oil.China and India were among the nations that abstained on Thursday when UN voted overwhelmingly to demand Moscow withdraw its troops from Ukraine and stop fighting.Besides the G7 nations, the G20 bloc also includes countries such as Australia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.“It’s becoming difficult for the G20 to engage in constructive discussion because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is an act that shakes the foundations of the global order,” Japanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters.Debt negotiationsOn the sidelines, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) held a meeting on Saturday with the World Bank, China, India, Saudi Arabia and the G7 on restructuring debt for distressed economies, but there, too, were disagreements among members, said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.“We just finished a session in which it was clear that there is a commitment to bridge differences for the benefit of countries,” Georgieva, who co-chaired the roundtable with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, told reporters.One delegate told Reuters that some initial progress was made, mostly on the language around the issue, but restructuring was not discussed in detail.Yellen said there were no “deliverables” from the meeting, which was mostly organisational.Further discussions are planned around the time of the IMF and World Bank meetings in April.Pressure has been building on China, the world’s largest bilateral creditor, and other nations to take a large haircut in loans given to struggling developing nations.In a video address to the G20 meeting on Friday, Chinese finance minister Liu Kun reiterated Beijing’s position that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks should also participate in debt relief by taking haircuts.India’s push for tougher regulation of private cryptocurrency assets won wider support at the meeting.Georgieva said policymakers “should not take off the table” the option of outright bans if regulation failed. Yellen did not back such bans, but said it was critical to put in place a strong regulatory framework.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05854,0.37677,5345,5,4,9,0,0

7,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/25/as-long-as-it-takes-us-aid-to-ukraine-sustainable-experts-say,"Washington, DC – The words “as long as it takes” have become a rallying cry for American officials as they support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion, signalling an open-ended commitment to help Kyiv.US President Joe Biden put it bluntly on Tuesday when he said in a speech that the United States and its allies will “not tire” of backing Ukraine — a message seemingly directed at his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.Since Russia launched its assault a year ago, the US has provided billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, which experts say is necessary not only to back Ukrainians but to advance US national interests.Despite opposition from some US politicians, Washington should be able to maintain this level of support to Kyiv in the long term, analysts argue.“This policy is definitely sustainable,” said Simon Miles, an assistant professor at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy.Miles told Al Jazeera that, while the assistance seems significant in terms of the dollar amount when put in the context of the entire US government budget, the numbers are “not overly large pieces of the whole pie”.“The amounts of money we’re talking about are, I think, a pretty small price to pay if you look at what the alternative is — what it would mean for Vladimir Putin to succeed, for not just the United States and its place in the world but in fact for the entire global commons.”‘Appeasement doesn’t work’Washington marked the first anniversary of the invasion on Friday by announcing new aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia — the two main tools it has used to back Kyiv.“The United States will continue to work with its allies and partners to provide Ukraine with capabilities to meet its immediate battlefield needs and longer-term security assistance requirements for as long as it takes,” the Pentagon said on Friday.The US Congress approved more than $100bn for Ukraine through four spending bills last year — funds that the Biden administration has been dispensing through periodic military, humanitarian and budgetary aid to Kyiv.According to the Treasury Department, the US government spent $6.27 trillion overall in the 2022 fiscal year.“We have learned repeatedly in the 20th century that appeasement or hiding from reality doesn’t work. It only encourages the aggressor,” said Igor Lukes, a professor of international affairs at Boston University’s Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies.Lukes added that, if Putin were to conquer Ukraine and get to its western borders, Russia would be “eyeball to eyeball” with several NATO countries, including Poland and Romania.The US-led alliance has a collective defence pact, meaning an attack on one country is considered an attack on all.“Opposing Putin now and opposing him in Ukraine is an American national interest,” Lukes told Al Jazeera.He said the war in Ukraine is “clear-cut” foreign aggression by one sovereign nation against another, making it a global matter. “The war is not about Ukraine only. It’s also about us,” he explained.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that assessment at the United Nations Security Council on Friday.“Nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine because we all recognise that, if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure,” Blinken said.Some right-wing US legislators have criticised Biden’s visit to Ukraine [Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP Photo]Far-right dissentStill, a small but vocal contingency of far-right legislators in the US Congress has been increasingly critical of Washington’s aid to Ukraine.Ultraconservative legislators slammed Biden earlier this week for visiting Ukraine, accusing him of ignoring crises at home in favour of a foreign conflict.Lukes said such voices are “waiting for an opportunity to make a spectacle of themselves” and remain on the fringe, stressing that Ukraine has been a unifying issue in a deeply divided Washington.I think Senator Romney would be the first to tell you that we don’t always agree.But he knows what I know: that standing with Ukraine — and standing up for freedom — advances our national security. https://t.co/X67SkDIL6W— President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2023Matthew Pauly, an associate professor of history at Michigan State University, said no one can advance a “reasonable argument” that a Russian victory in Ukraine would not threaten US interests.Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 — one year ago — after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as Putin demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.But Washington stresses the invasion is not about NATO or Russian security interests but is rather a push by Putin to erase Ukraine’s national identity.“This is a war that is imposed on a sovereign nation by another nation. And if the Ukrainians are willing to fight for the security and peace of Europe, the least the US can do is support them in this effort because it’s in the direct strategic interests of the United States,” Pauly said.He described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a “discernible” threat to the US.“The defence budget — some can argue about the nature of that but why does it exist if not to protect the United States? So in my view, this is where expenditures are absolutely justified because the security threat is real,” Pauly told Al Jazeera.‘Just and durable’ peacePauly stressed that Ukrainians desperately want peace.On Friday, Blinken called on the international community to pursue a “just and durable” peace in Ukraine.“History teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters,” Blinken said.“For peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence. For peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can’t simply rest, rearm and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.”Pauly said a just peace would entail “the liberation of all Ukrainian territory”, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.For his part, Miles, the public policy professor at Duke University, said it will be up to the Ukrainian government to decide where to draw the line.“The mood in Kyiv today really does not seem to be that they’re interested in ceding any ground,” he added. “They’re going to prosecute this to the finish, in large part because they don’t want a sort of frozen conflict or a simmering grey zone conflict going on on their borders.”But Putin has signalled that Russia will not relent and will pursue the conflict for the long run.Miles said that, though the Russian army has been “greatly degraded” after “taking a beating” over the past year, Putin will still have a major say in when the war ends.Some dovish foreign policy advocates and European leaders have warned against pushing Putin too hard, noting that — despite its setbacks in Ukraine — Russia remains a nuclear power.Russian officials have hinted at the risk of a nuclear war over the past year but Washington says there has been no detected change in Moscow’s nuclear posture.Pauly said that, while threats should be taken seriously, Russia’s intent is to “weaken [the] unified resolve” of the US and its allies.Miles also played down Moscow’s nuclear threats or risks of direct confrontation between the US and Russia.“What message does it send to other nuclear powers, other would-be nuclear powers, if they believe that you can get away with anything by just rattling the nuclear sabre?” Miles said.“I think a world in which there are no consequences for states with nuclear weapons for grotesque misbehaviour, like Vladimir Putin right now, is a more dangerous world.”",0.01541,0.36849,7781,23,7,17,10,0

What was supposed to be key here is a message of solidarity with Ukraine on this special day,” said one diplomat involved in the confidential negotiations between the 27 EU countries in the bloc’s hub Brussels.Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal posed in front of four Leopard battle tanks provided by Poland and posted a series of photos of them being handed over as his embattled nation marked a year since the start of the invasion.Shmyhal stood with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki for the images posted on Telegram.“A year ago, tanks went to Ukraine to deprive Ukrainians of their freedom,” Schmyhal said. “Today, tanks have also entered Ukraine, but to protect freedom.”Poland is giving Ukraine 14 Leopard A2 tanks. Morawiecki also said 60 PT-91 main battle tanks would be provided after they were promised in January.The PT-91 Twardy is a Polish combat vehicle based on the Soviet T-72 tank but further developed and modernised.Earlier, Poland’s defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak said Ukrainian soldiers would be trained by Polish, Canadian and Norwegian instructors at the Leopard training centre in western Poland.",0.10864,0.40752,3806,14,8,12,0,0

He fought back tears at the national anthem.“We have become one family … Ukrainians have sheltered Ukrainians, opened their homes and hearts to those who were forced to flee the war,” he said in a televised address.“We withstand all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, kamikaze drones, blackouts and cold … And we will do everything to gain victory this year.”Zelenskyy, who has himself become a symbol of Ukraine’s refusal to bow to Moscow, said Ukrainians proved themselves to be invincible during “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”.“We have been standing for exactly one year,” Zelenskyy said. February 24, 2022, he said, was “the longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven’t fallen asleep since.”A wounded Ukrainian serviceman and his girlfriend walk past national flags each of which symbolises the dead servicepeople set at Independence Square in Kyiv [File: Sergei Supinsky/AFP]Around the country, Ukrainians looked back at a year that changed their lives and at the clouded future. They wept at memorials for their tens of thousands of dead — a toll growing inexorably as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine in particular.“I can sum up the last year in three words: Fear, love, hope,” Oleksandr Hranyk, a school director in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said.Lining up in the capital, Kyiv, to buy anniversary commemorative postage stamps, Tetiana Klimkova described her heart as “falling and hurting”.Still, “this day has become a symbol for me that we have survived for a whole year and will continue to live,” she said. “On this day, our children and grandchildren will remember how strong Ukrainians are mentally, physically, and spiritually.”Speaking from Kyiv, Ukrainian member of parliament Sviatoslav Yurash said that his countrymen felt as defiant as they did a year ago.“We want an independent and democratic Ukraine and we will certainly get that. We have been strengthened throughout this year.”Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers on both sides are believed to have died since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, saying it was necessary to protect Russia’s security.Ukraine sees it as a bid to subjugate an independent state. Its outnumbered and outgunned forces repelled Russia’s attempt to seize the capital Kyiv early in the war and later recaptured swaths of occupied territory. But Moscow still occupies nearly a fifth of Ukraine, which it claims to have annexed.Russia’s foreign ministry said the world should recognise “new territorial realities” in Ukraine to achieve peace.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a working session of G7 leaders via video link  [Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via Reuters]Calls for ceasefireAlthough China called for a ceasefire on Friday, peace was nowhere in sight. Ukraine previously rejected a pause in the fighting for fear it would allow Russia to regroup militarily after bruising battlefield setbacks.Zelenskyy gave qualified support to China’s apparent new interest in playing a diplomatic role, saying, “The fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad.”“But the question is what follows the words,” he said during a wide-ranging news conference. “The question is in the steps and where they will lead to.”A 12-point paper issued by China’s foreign ministry also urged an end to sanctions that aim to squeeze Russia’s economy.As a ceasefire appeared unlikely, Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said that Ukraine was “entering a new period, with a new task – to win.”“It will not be easy. But we will manage,” he added. “There is rage and a desire to avenge the fallen.”Air raid alarms did not sound overnight in Kyiv, alleviating concerns that Russia might unleash another barrage of missiles to pile yet more misery on Ukraine on the anniversary.More sanctions, tanksMeanwhile, Western nations were working to further tighten sanctions. Washington on Friday announced a new $2bn package of military aid for Ukraine, and a raft of additional sanctions and tariffs hitting Russia’s mining and metals industries, as well as companies from third countries accused of supplying Moscow with restricted goods. Other G7 countries unveiled similar measures.“One year on, the commitment of the United States, together with some 50 countries who have rallied to rush urgently needed assistance to Ukraine, has only strengthened,” the US defence department said.In a news release, the White House said the new measures were designed to disrupt Russian financial institutions, officials and authorities from “illegitimately operating in Ukraine”.US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a televised address that a main objective behind the sanctions “has been to degrade Russia’s ability to wage war, to deprive it of the goods it needs to supply its military through sanctions and export controls. We have been quite successful in doing that”.“Over 9,000 Russian tanks have been destroyed over the last year and the biggest tank factories are shut down because they are unable to gain access to the input that they need to repair or rebuild tanks,” she added.Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, said US President Joe Biden and the G7 have agreed to further isolate Russia in terms of its means of financing its war machine.“What Russia has been able to do so far is find partnerships with North Korea and Iran to keep its war machine going,” said Halkett. “This latest round of sanctions is all about trying to incapacitate those kinds of partnerships and to isolate Russia from the global financial system.”She explained that the latest sanctions target 200 Russian entities and individuals, and are tied to specific sectors of Russia’s economy, namely defence and the tech industry.In addition to the sanctions, NATO member Poland said it had delivered four advanced Leopard 2A4 tanks, making it the first country to hand the German-made armour to Ukraine.Poland’s prime minister said on a visit to Kyiv that more Leopards were coming. Poland’s defence minister said contributions from other countries would help form Ukraine’s first Leopard battalion of 31 tanks.",0.05798,0.3476,6542,18,6,17,1,5

We will study it thoroughly,” she added. “The only thing that I want to clarify is what is the basis for this peace because we believe in justice and fair peace, not appeasement.”How have Western allies reacted?The 12-point document did not reveal any new initiatives, and Western diplomats and experts reacted with scepticism and disappointment, noting that China is not neutral and has not condemned Russia’s invasion.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing was not well-placed to negotiate an end to the war.“China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine,” he told reporters in Tallinn, adding that Beijing had signed an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before the invasion.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed Stoltenberg’s sentiments, saying China had not shared a peace plan but some principles.“You have to see them against a specific backdrop, and that is the backdrop that China has already taken sides by signing, for example, an unlimited friendship right before the invasion,” she said.“So we will look at the principles, of course, but we will look at them against the backdrop that China has taken sides,” the former German defence minister said.A spokesperson for Germany’s government noted important elements, such as a call for the withdrawal of Russian forces, were missing from the proposal.“It is important that China now discusses these ideas directly with Ukraine as this is the only way to find a balanced solution that takes Ukraine’s legitimate interests into account,” the spokesperson said.What do experts say?Nicholas Bequelin, visiting fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, told Al Jazeera that China can’t be an effective mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war and the proposals put out “reflects this”.“This is not a plan; there is no action that China proposes,” Bequelin said. “What it does is it articulates a set of principles about the way China sees this conflict. China really is in a bind over the Ukraine conflict because it doesn’t welcome the war. It causes untold problems to China in its relationship with Europe, to its economy, to its place in the world.“At the same time, what is deeply ingraining Beijing’s views of the world is that a showdown with the US is on the horizon,” he said. “Sooner or later, a showdown with the West will happen because the West is trying to contain China’s rise, and as a result, it cannot afford to forgo an ally like Russia. So it has to pretend to be neutral while staying somewhat on the side of Russia and certainly not accepting to be enrolled in the war efforts waged by the US and NATO.”",0.10289,0.37829,5834,14,12,12,1,2
12,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/24/us-announces-new-ukraine-aid-russia-sanctions-on-war-anniversary,"Washington, DC – The United States has announced a new, $2bn military aid package to Ukraine and issued a new sanctions targeting Russia’s metals and mining sector and financial institutions, as well as international firms with alleged ties to Moscow’s push to evade previous sanctions.The two separate US moves on Friday coincided with the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and underscored the US strategy of backing Kyiv in the war.“The United States stands strongly with Ukraine as it defends itself, and we will continue to do so until Ukraine’s sovereignty is respected and the people of Ukraine can shape their chosen, democratic future in freedom and peace,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Friday.The new aid package includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), artillery rounds, drones, secure communication equipment and funding for “training, maintenance, and sustainment”, the Pentagon said.“The United States will continue to work with its Allies and partners to provide Ukraine with capabilities to meet its immediate battlefield needs and longer-term security assistance requirements for as long as it takes,” it added in a statement.Russian officials have said that sending arms to Ukraine prolongs and intensifies the conflict.Meanwhile, on Friday, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned dozens of Russian entities and targeted more than 30 companies and individuals across the world it accused of links “to Russia’s sanctions evasion efforts, including those related to arms trafficking and illicit finance”.The measures blocked the companies’ assets in the US and prohibited Americans from doing business with them.Washington and its allies have imposed hundreds of sanctions on Russian banks, tech companies and wealthy elites connected to President Vladimir Putin.But Moscow has signalled that it would be undeterred by the financial measures, pledging to “cope with any challenge”.“The United States will continue to impose costs on Russia for as long as this war continues,” the US Treasury said on Friday.Treasury secretary Janet Yellen told MSNBC that the sanctions are having a “significant impact” on Russia’s economy and defence industry.“We’re depriving them of the revenues that they need to wage war,” Yellen said, noting that Moscow is now selling its oil at a “very substantial discount” due to price caps.The Department of State also targeted dozens of Russian officials, including governors and government ministers, and entities with its own sanctions on Friday, promising to continue taking action against Moscow until it ends its “brutal war” in Ukraine.Speaking at the United Nations Security Council later on Friday, Blinken said any peace in Ukraine must not legitimise “Russia’s seizure of land by force”.“Nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine because we all recognise that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure,” Blinken said.Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 – one year ago – after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as Putin demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.Moscow’s war campaign has been mired by military setbacks, as Western powers stepped up financial and military support to Kyiv.",0.08449,0.32312,3419,12,5,11,2,0

Putin can’t scare us off,” she told Al Jazeera at the time during a training session by the city’s Azov Regiment. “We will stand for our Ukraine until the very end,”A group of older women who had volunteered for the war effort since 2014, nicknamed the “Babushka Battalion”, said they would take up arms or even go “mano a mano” (hand to hand) if they had to protect their beloved city.Now, like many of Mariupol’s former residents, most are scattered all over Ukraine, and the world.Members of the army of grannies have ended up as far as Germany and the United Kingdom, but a few stayed in Mariupol.Liudmyla Smahlenko, 66, stayed in the Ukrainian port city to help with the deluge of wounded at a local hospital before escaping and relocating to Norway midyear.Valentyna Konstantynovska, 79, training for the imminent Russian invasion in Mariupol, Ukraine on February 13, 2022 [File: Emre Caylak/Al Jazeera]No returnOne year on from the start of the war, Konstantinovska is currently living in Vita-Pochtovaya, near Kyiv, after stints in Poland and Spain.She returned to Ukraine to once again help the front by volunteering six days a week to gather supplies and weave nets.“I never wanted to leave Mariupol. I thought I would be useful there. I attended classes so I could help the wounded – we were set to resist,” she said.However, on February 26, 2022, Konstantinovska received a call from her granddaughter, who has diabetes and was in Poland.She said she had fainted while looking after her daughter because her blood sugar dropped to dangerously low levels, and that no one was around to help.Knowing how serious diabetes and its repercussions can be, Konstantinovska threw on some clean trousers, a sweater and some food into a backpack and rushed to catch the 3pm train west to Lviv.Once on board, the conductor informed her it was the last train out of Mariupol. A few hours later, the track was blown up, and within a few days, the city had been completely cut off.“It was only when I got to Poland that I discovered my family had made the whole thing up to lure me out of Mariupol. My children understood the consequences of my refusal to leave,” she said.“I only turned the heater down a little bit when I left thinking it would be nice to come back to a warm apartment when I return. I had no idea I would never go back.”She learned from neighbours who stayed that her house in Mariupol has since been destroyed and her belongings looted.“Things that can’t be replaced are gone,” she said. “Gifts my late husband bought from overseas when he was a captain. But everyone in my family is alive with all their arms and legs. I have started a new life that will lead to victory.”Fight between good and evilThe siege of Mariupol is the worst atrocity Russian forces in Ukraine are accused of to date.In Mariupol, Russia is accused of multiple alleged war crimes, including an attack on a drama theatre that is thought to have killed more than 600 people, according to an investigation by The Associated Press news agency, the last remaining media organisation in the city as the violence escalated.With tens of thousands of people fleeing for safety, a once tight-knit community has been changed forever.Friends, neighbours, and people who coexisted together for their entire lives, now live miles apart.The people Al Jazeera interviewed in Mariupol last year are now spread around the globe: the UK, Canada, Portugal, Turkey, the United States and France.On the first night of the war, Al Jazeera met Viktorii and Andriy Voytsekhovskyy who were seeking shelter in a subterranean church.Earlier that day, Andriy had a lucky escape. A grad rocket crashed into an apartment 15 metres (49 feet) from him as he walked his Jack Russell, Chelsea, near their home in the city’s left bank.Andriy and his wife Viktorii Voytsekhovskyy, both 28, left their house in Mariupol at the beginning of the war and first stayed in an evangelical church for shelter [File: Emre Caylak/Al Jazeera]With their neighbourhood among the worst affected, being hit with missiles even before the invasion began, they fled the following day.Viktorii and the couple’s son, Leon, then two years old, made it to the Netherlands, but Andriy was unable to leave Ukraine because men aged 18 and 60 were instructed to stay and fight the Russians.Viktorii and Leon have now moved to Ternopil, western Ukraine, to be close to Andriy, who is a humanitarian volunteer.Living for years within 20km (12 miles) of the tense front line with Russian proxy forces, the family invented a fairytale to soothe Leon’s fears.There is an “evil king” and he wants them to be afraid, but they will not give him that.Now, Viktorii is in the final stages of finishing her first animated film based on the story, which she plans to release later this year.“It helped my son understand what was going on – it was a fight between good and evil. He called the jets ‘evil dragons’ that were ‘spitting fire everywhere’, the tanks for him were caterpillars with guns,” she said.It gave her the idea to depict the war in Ukraine through a child’s eyes. The film’s production team is made up of Ukrainians who fled Mariupol.“If I had not been able to do something like this, I think I would go crazy,” she said. “We never feel safe any more, it’s very stressful. We live every day as if it could be our last.”Konstantinovska, on the other hand, feels no trauma after losing everything.Only “anger and hatred towards the Russians”, she said.If she had stayed in Mariupol, she thinks she would probably be among the first dead.“If I had got caught, I’d have bitten these Russians – that’s how angry I was at them,” she said. “Crying does not buy you freedom. It is the one who fights that gains the world.”",-0.00825,0.42249,6336,9,8,8,1,0

The aid will include more rounds of ammunition and a variety of small, high-tech drones, the Pentagon said in a statement.The United States also slapped new sanctions on Russia and its allies, and more export controls and tariffs aimed at undermining Moscow’s ability to wage war.NATO: ‘Russia bears full responsibility’In a statement, NATO said it was “resolute” in its support of Ukraine.“Russia bears full responsibility for this war, a blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter,” NATO said. “Russia’s efforts to break the resolve of the brave people of Ukraine are failing.”Moscow must “immediately” end its “illegal war” which is affecting global food and energy supplies and answer for its “war crimes”, it added.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz: ‘Putin can end this war’Scholz said Putin will not reach his aims in Ukraine.“The earlier the Russian president realises that he will not reach his imperialistic goal, the bigger the chance that the war will end soon. Putin has it in his hands. He can end this war,” he said.French President Emmanuel Macron: ‘France stands by your side’Macron reiterated France’s support for Ukraine.“People of Ukraine, France stands by your side.

All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiralling out of control,” the ministry said in its paper.Putin has signalled he will double down on the Ukraine conflict, despite major battlefield defeats in the past year, and has raised the spectre of nuclear weapons.China said they must be avoided. “Nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought,” the foreign ministry said. “We oppose development, use of biological and chemical weapons by any country under any circumstances.”Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to deliver a “peace speech” later on Friday, in which he is likely to urge peace while avoiding condemnation of Russia.King Charles III: Ukrainians have shown ‘remarkable courage’King Charles III praised Ukraine’s “remarkable courage and resilience” on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion.“It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation,” the British monarch said in a statement.“They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy,” he added.Britain’s King Charles III meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his first visit to the UK since the Russian invasion of Ukraine at Buckingham Palace, London, on February 8, 2023 [Aaron Chown/Pool via Reuters]",0.11327,0.32239,4793,17,11,13,5,3
15,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/24/five-key-ways-the-us-has-supported-ukraines-war-effort,"Washington, DC – United States officials often stress that Russia has failed in its war in Ukraine, citing Moscow’s battlefield setbacks and its failure to capture Kyiv in a lightning offensive a year ago.While the US credits Ukrainian forces for halting Russian advances, it also says aid from Washington and its allies has been instrumental in helping Kyiv fight on.President Joe Biden regularly reiterates that the US will support Ukraine “as long as it takes” to repel Moscow’s invasion.“There should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided and we will not tire,” Biden said in Warsaw earlier this week.As the war enters its second year this week, Al Jazeera revisits key ways the US has assisted Ukraine so far:Billions in aidThe core component of US support has been the military, humanitarian and budgetary aid the Biden administration has been providing to Kyiv.The US Congress, which dictates the federal government’s budget, moved quickly after the invasion on February 24, 2022, to authorise billions of dollars for Ukraine, giving the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies the resources to keep the assistance flowing.In March, US legislators approved $13.6bn for Kyiv. That was followed by $40bn in May and another $12bn in September.Thank you 🇺🇸Congress, @SpeakerPelosi,@GOPLeader, @LeaderMcConnell,@SenSchumer, @SenatorLeahy, @rosadelauro for additional $45 bln aid to 🇺🇦,& for unwavering bipartisan support 🇺🇦 in our fight for freedom. It’s crucial that 🇺🇸people’re side by side w/ 🇺🇦people in this struggle.— Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) December 23, 2022In December, Congress passed another government funding bill containing $45bn in Ukraine aid.The Biden administration has been dispensing the aid in periodic packages over the past year.Unleashing sanctionsWhile the US often says it is not seeking a direct confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, Washington has been using economic measures to penalise Moscow for the invasion.Since the start of the war, the US has imposed hundreds of sanctions against Russian government officials, companies and wealthy elites connected to President Vladimir Putin.The first round of US sanctions was announced on the day Russia launched its invasion. The sanctions were aimed at tech imports and large financial institutions in Russia. Many more sanctions would follow.“Putin is the aggressor; Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said as the invasion began.In March, Biden banned US imports of Russian oil.After Moscow announced the annexation of four eastern Ukrainian territories in September, Washington also imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russia-linked firms and officials.For his part, Putin has called US and Western sanctions “stupid”, stressing that Russia will not be deterred by the economic measures.“We are strong people and can cope with any challenge. Like our ancestors, we will solve any problem. The entire thousand-year history of our country speaks of this,” the Russian president said in June.Weapons: Javelins, HIMARs and tanksOver the past year, the US administration has announced dozens of military aid packages to Ukraine – assistance that the Pentagon says is tailored to the needs of the battlefield.Early in the conflict, US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles proved decisive in repelling the Russian campaign for Kyiv. As Russia shifted its focus to capturing eastern parts of Ukraine, Washington likewise adjusted its military assistance.The US began supplying Ukrainian forces with howitzers and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), helping Ukraine recapture the city of Kherson, as well as significant parts of the eastern region of the Donbas and the southern region of Kharkiv.A Patriot missile air defence system followed in December as Russia intensified its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure.Last month, Biden announced more military equipment for Ukraine, including its first delivery of Abrams tanks.“They need to be able to counter Russia’s evolving tactics and strategy on the battlefield in the very near term,” Biden said of Ukrainian forces in January.“They need to improve their ability to manoeuvre in open terrain and they need an enduring capability to deter and defend against Russian aggression over the long term.”Russian officials have said sending arms to Ukraine prolongs and intensifies the conflict.Abuse accusations and calls for accountabilityMere weeks after the war broke out, US officials accused Russian forces of perpetrating human-rights abuses in Ukraine.In March, Biden drew a rebuke from the Kremlin when he called Putin a “war criminal”, which Moscow described as “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”.The State Department said around the same time that it had determined some members of the Russian military had committed “war crimes” during the conflict.A month later, the US president accused Russia of inflicting “genocide” against Ukraine.More recently, Washington said it determined that Russian forces committed “crimes against humanity” — defined as systemic or widespread abuses directed against civilians — during the war.The Biden administration has coupled such charges with calls for accountability, backing Ukrainian and international efforts to investigate and prosecute any abuses.Russia has rejected the US accusations as an attempt to “demonise” Moscow and inflame tensions.Diplomatic supportDays ahead of the first anniversary of the war, Ukrainians received an unexpected guest in their capital city: the president of the United States.Biden’s visit to Kyiv this week aimed to highlight the US commitment to Ukraine as well as the shortcomings of the Russian offensive.“One year later, Kyiv stands,” Biden said after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.US President Joe Biden walks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at St Michael’s Golden-Domed Cathedral in Kyiv on February 20 [Evan Vucci/AP Photo]The following day, the US president delivered a speech on the war from Warsaw, promising that “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia”.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin also visited Ukraine over the past year.

We all want it to happen as soon as possible. And that day will come,” said Medvedev. He predicted that tough negotiations with Ukraine and the West would culminate in “some kind of agreement”.But he said that deal would lack “fundamental agreements on real borders” and not amount to an overarching European security pact, making it vital for Russia to extend its borders now.“That is why it is so important to achieve all the goals of the special military operation. To push back the borders that threaten our country as far as possible, even if they are the borders of Poland,” said Medvedev.Poland shares long eastern borders with Ukraine and with Russia’s ally Belarus, and a frontier of some 200km (125 miles) in its northeastern corner with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.Any encroachment on Poland’s borders would bring Russia for the first time into direct conflict with NATO.US President Joe Biden pledged in a speech in Warsaw this week to defend “every inch” of NATO territory if it was attacked.Medvedev, 57, has adopted an increasingly hawkish tone and made a series of outspoken interventions since the war began, with some political analysts suggesting he is one of the people that President Vladimir Putin might one day consider as a successor.In his state-of-the-nation speech earlier this week, the Russian president announced the suspension of a nuclear arms treaty with the US and blamed the government in Kyiv for taking the Ukrainian people “hostage” and failing to address their needs.“They [Ukrainian government] intend to transform a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation,” Putin said on Tuesday. This is exactly how we understand it all, and we will react accordingly because, in this case, we are talking about the existence of our country.”Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.0841,0.3917,3030,4,2,8,2,0
17,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/24/ukrainians-on-first-anniversary-of-russias-war-i-worry-a-lot,"Kyiv, Ukraine – Tens of thousands of Ukrainians have died in Russia’s war in Ukraine, which is entering a second year. Millions have been forced from their homes. And those who have survived are desperate for their pre-war lives to return.We spoke to four Ukrainians in Kyiv, the capital, on the first anniversary of the conflict.‘Difficult to see kids who came to fight die after two or three days’Oleksander Protsuk, 27, a serviceman, former plumber:“Everything changed. I was a civilian person, a hard-working guy, single, never served in the army. The war forced me to take up arms, to protect my country, because the former ‘brotherly’ nation attacked us.“The most difficult part was to see how young kids who came to fight die after two or three days. I serve in the Donetsk region, in the town of Pervomaysk. I am going home, got 10 days off duty, I hope to have some rest and get back there.“In a year, Ukraine will thrive. It will be an independent country. We will build a huge fence to separate us from Russia, let them live their lives, rot behind the fence.“And the West will thrive together with us, for we are part of Europe. And Russia should rot, we’ve parted ways with them. They will not be forgiven by my generation, and I hope, the next one. I hope for it.”‘The war made everything worse in my life’Tetiana Kravchuk, 44, a sales clerk at a stationery store in central Kyiv:“The war made everything worse in my life. I earn less. I can’t move around the way I used to.“In the past, I would visit my mum, who is 67, in [the northern region of] Chernihiv, near Belarus. My son used to take me, but now, he can’t [because men his age are not allowed to leave the region they live in]. I can’t go there by myself because I’ll have to change buses three times.“I worry a lot. I don’t sleep. I worry about my [two] sons, they may be drafted. I don’t want them to go to war, but if they have to, they will. I am a religious person, and I hope God will spare their lives.”‘The Poles understand very well’Snizhana Kapryichuk, architect:“The first days were scary.“On the third day, I left for western Ukraine and then for Poland. Many Poles tried to help. The Poles understand very well, understand what we encountered, because they have their own historic experience with Russia and understand how unsafe it is.“Financially, things got worse, all the businesses are half-suspended. The company I worked for before the war was building several apartment complexes that were damaged by shelling. Understandably, everything stopped.”‘Prices are up, there’s inflation, the country may go bankrupt’Kyrylo Borysenko, 23, a serviceman in the Kyiv region:“I lost many childhood friends. Many people are jobless. Prices are up, there’s inflation, the country may go bankrupt. Many people die, there’s too much blood.“But as to positive things, people are united, they stand for each other. The boys that are fighting [on the front lines], civilians showed the strength of their spirit. We’re from Ukraine, you can’t break us, because our spirit is strong.“God willing, the war will be over in a year. I am 100 percent sure the victory will be ours. They lack motivation, they don’t have enough spirit, those Russians. Since 2014, I have been hating Russia. I don’t want a single country on planet Earth to have a neighbour like Russia.”",0.02998,0.39459,3339,5,8,7,0,0
18,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/24/has-the-ukraine-war-strengthened-europe-or-weakened-it,"In 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist that Europe could no longer rely on NATO for its defence but needed to become a geostrategic power in its own right.“What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” he said, in what has become an infamous quote.A series of crises since then — the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war, and the resulting energy crisis — have strengthened Europe’s strategic energy autonomy.The European Union has banned Russian coal and oil and is transitioning towards renewable energy sources at unprecedented speed.But fundamental differences still divide Europeans on security, begging the question of whether the Ukraine war will ultimately leave the European project stronger. “What I’d call the European core has been weakened — the Franco-German axis, Italy under [former prime minister Mario] Draghi — you had a trio that saw eye-to-eye when it came to foreign policy, had similar concerns, and had always been the driver of European integration,” said George Pagoulatos, the director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, a think tank.Draghi resigned last July after losing a confidence vote and has been replaced by the far-right eurosceptic Giorgia Meloni.Elections last April left Macron leading a minority government in parliament, while Germany has suffered enormous damage to its reputation by appearing reluctant to arm Ukraine with tanks, even though it has supplied many defensive weapons.‘Moral high ground has shifted’“The moral high ground has shifted from the core of Europe to the northeastern part of Europe. They have won the public narrative in Europe and the Western camp, which is that Ukraine must win the war and Russia must be defeated, almost at all costs. They are saying it with greater clarity than anyone else,” Pagoulatos said.In contrast, Macron and his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, were chiefly noted for their frequent, lengthy phone calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the early days of the war, and for appearing to have miscalculated his malice.“The Baltic and Nordic and Central European states have been much more Transatlantic-oriented on foreign and defence policy. The US and UK have been their most important security partners, and Germany and France have never been so relevant in this region in that regard,” said Minna Ålander, research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.That became clear in 2003 when Eastern Europe broke ranks with the European majority to back George W Bush’s second Gulf War.Even after Bush’s policy proved a disaster, Macron’s call for greater strategic autonomy never convinced the northeast, Ålander told Al Jazeera.“There wasn’t much fondness towards this concept anyway, but now it has become clear that it has become an illusion and it’s not do-able any time soon, we depend on the US and that’s something we have to acknowledge.”This past Tuesday, as US President Joe Biden visited Warsaw, Polish President Andrzej Duda told him, “America is able to maintain the global order.”‘Europe isn’t strong enough right now’Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO has quadrupled its rapid reaction forces stationed in Eastern European states to 40,000, moved more equipment there, and pledged to raise its high readiness forces to 300,000.Europe, in contrast, pledged to form a force of 5,000 that will be operational in 2027.Even before the Ukraine war, Europe was not demonstrating unity or efficacy on defence.Only two other EU members contributed troops to France’s Operation Barkhane to defeat armed groups in the Sahel, and the force was wound up last year without achieving its objectives.Finnish President Sanna Marin told a think tank in Sydney about the gap between words and deeds last December.“I must be brutally honest with you, Europe isn’t strong enough right now. We would be in trouble without the United States,” she told the Lowy Institute. “The United States has given a lot of weapons, a lot of financial aid, a lot of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Europe isn’t strong enough yet.”The EU officially recognised NATO’s primacy in a joint statement in January, calling it “the foundation of collective defence for its Allies and essential for Euro Atlantic security,” while referring to European defence as “complementary” to NATO.Major hurdles to overcomeEU leaders point to what has been achieved in a short time.“The war in Ukraine … has made us wake up to a kind of adulthood,” EU high representative Josep Borrell told the Munich Security Conference on February 19.“We have rediscovered the brutality of the interstate war at our borders and we are becoming a credible actor, able to use coercion to the ones who threaten us … We are becoming a hard power.”The EU did manage to pass nine packages of sanctions against Russia unanimously.It sent lethal weapons beyond its borders for the first time, shipping more than $12bn worth of artillery, armoured vehicles and air defences to Ukraine last year. And it invited Ukraine and Moldova to start membership talks within weeks of receiving their applications. Normally, years would have intervened.But to be a “more sovereign and geopolitical Europe”, in the words of Scholz, the EU has to overcome obstacles.One is a requirement of unanimity in foreign policy decision-making because foreign policy divides Europeans by geography and history.A December Eurobarometer poll found that, while 74 percent of EU citizens approved of the bloc’s support for Ukraine on average, that support fell just below 50 percent in Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia, and just more than 50 percent in Cyprus, Hungary, Romania and Austria.Several of those countries are overwhelmingly majority Orthodox.A January poll by Euroskopia revealed that most people in Austria (64 percent), Germany (60 percent) and Greece (54 percent), and 50 percent in Italy and Spain were in favour of an early land-for-peace compromise with Russia.“The risk of an individual country using its veto and preventing all the others from forging ahead increases with each additional member state,” said Scholz in a speech to Charles University in Prague last August. “I have therefore proposed a gradual transition to majority voting in common foreign policy.”This will likely not be easy.The first attempt to introduce qualified majority voting (QMV) at the Nice summit in 2000 collapsed amid bitter arguments about how majorities should be formed. Subsequent attempts to enshrine QMV in a European Constitution were defeated in French and Dutch referendums in 2005. And the feeling of inexorable federalism led the United Kingdom to leave the EU in 2016.Europe also spends too little on defence to wield the “hard power” Borrell spoke of, and this has undermined French and German attempts to recover their leadership roles.Scholz famously raised German defence spending by 100 billion euros ($106bn) days after the Russian invasion, but his defence minister resigned this year amid revelations that the money has barely begun to be spent and Germany’s armed forces remain a shambles.Macron, who first raised the standard of strategic autonomy, has faced weeks of protests on the streets of France because he introduced legislation raising retirement from 62 to 65 — hardly the picture of a society ready to shift spending to defence.‘Strategic autonomy probably has died’But perhaps the biggest challenge to European strategic autonomy concerns the posture towards Russia.This is not a problem in the United States, where there has so far been bipartisan support for Ukraine.“The majority of both right and left [in the US] see this as an opportunity in which Western NATO troops are not dying, but we can put our foot on Russia’s throat and put them in a position where they might not ever be a direct threat to us again,” said Colonel Dale Buckner, a retired special forces commander who runs Global Guardian, a security consultancy.“Whatever political posturing goes on, there’s no way we’re taking our foot off this,” he told Al Jazeera.Only the staunchest opponents of Russia would agree with that in Europe.“[Germans] lead this tendency in the EU to try to integrate Russia into some sort of security architecture which would make sure Russia does not repeat its aggressions against other countries and would seek to reactivate economic relations after the war has ended,” said Pagoulatos.Germany had refused to send German tanks to Ukraine, or allow other countries that owned them to do so partly for this reason. Berlin has since relented.Then there is the problem of whether a separate European command and control capability would weaken NATO.“When it comes to security, which is what Macron had in mind when he mentioned strategic autonomy, it was to drive towards independence from the US and NATO — in this sense, strategic autonomy probably has died,” Panayiotis Ioakimidis, professor emeritus of political science at Athens University told Al Jazeera. “What we’re now talking about is a strong EU security pillar within NATO.”Some do not believe the matter will end there and welcome what they see as an overdue reckoning within the EU.“The EU has been in a permanent crisis for the past 15 years or so. It needs a fundamental rethinking of power in Europe and how it can be shared in different ways,” said Ålander.“Does it always depend on the Franco-German motor, or can it also work otherwise?”",0.12106,0.35423,9433,13,14,12,1,0

It included a call for a “just and lasting” peace.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed confidence in his country’s victory over invading Russian forces as fears mount over attacks on the war’s first anniversary.Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu accused the West of using Ukraine to try to break up Russia, but said he thought the attempt would fail.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance has seen signs China is considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step.China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, told the UN General Assembly that one year into the Ukraine war, “brutal facts offer an ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez went to Kyiv, becoming the latest world leader to visit the war-torn country’s capital.Sweden and Turkey plan to resume discussions in March on Sweden’s membership of NATO, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.Weapons:German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the West will continue to support Ukraine for as long as necessary, but it would not be “clever” for Ukraine to use the weapons it receives to mount attacks on Russian territory.President Vladimir Putin said the delayed Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile will be deployed this year.Spain may increase the number of Leopard 2A4 tanks it will send to Ukraine to 10, from the six promised earlier, and will discuss potential aircraft deliveries with its NATO and EU partners, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said during a visit to Kyiv.Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the Finnish defence ministry said.Fighting:Three ambulance workers trying to evacuate people from their homes in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by Ukrainian shelling, a Russian-installed official in the region said.Moldova dismissed claims by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway region of Transnistria – and instead called for calm.",0.03843,0.53148,2218,9,4,9,1,1
20,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/24/china-calls-for-russia-ukraine-cease-fire-proposes-peace-talks,"China has called for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia and a gradual de-escalation of the situation that will pave the way for peace talks, as part of a 12-point proposal to end the conflict.The plan by China, which was released on Friday morning by the foreign ministry and coincides with the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, urges an end to Western sanctions against Russia, the establishment of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, and steps to ensure the export of grain after disruptions caused global food prices to spike last year.“Conflict and war benefit no one,” the ministry said in a statement.“All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiralling out of control,” it said.“All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire.”The proposal mainly elaborates on long-held Chinese positions, including that all countries’ “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity be effectively guaranteed”. The plan also called for an end to the “Cold War mentality”, which is Beijing’s standard term for what it regards as global dominance by the United States and its interference in other countries’ affairs.Beijing — which claims to be neutral in the conflict — has a “no limits” relationship with Russia and has refused to criticise Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine or even refer to it as such. It has also accused the West of provoking the conflict and “fanning the flames” by providing Ukraine with arms.Beijing’s top diplomat Wang Yi visited Moscow this week and pledged a deeper relationship between the countries, while Putin hailed “new frontiers” in ties with Beijing and signalled that China’s leader Xi Jinping would visit Russia.Xi is expected to deliver a “peace speech” on Friday, though some analysts have cast doubt on whether Beijing’s efforts to act as a peacemaker will go beyond rhetoric.The ambassador of the European Union to China, Jorge Toledo, told reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Friday that China had released a position paper not a peace proposal, and the EU will study it.“If the position paper is a positive sign for Ukraine then it’s a positive sign for the EU, although we are studying the paper closely,” he said.Ukraine called the “position paper” “a good sign” and said it expects China to be more active in its support of Ukraine.“We hope they also urge Russia to stop the war and withdraw its troops,” Ukraine’s charge d’affaires Zhanna Leshchynska said at the same briefing.US State Department spokesman Ned Price had said earlier on Thursday that Washington would reserve judgement on the proposal but that China’s allegiance with Russia meant it was not a neutral mediator.“We would like to see nothing more than a just and durable peace … but we are sceptical that reports of a proposal like this will be a constructive path forward,” he said.On Thursday, China abstained from voting when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) approved a nonbinding resolution that called for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces.The UNGA overwhelmingly adopted the resolution that demanded Moscow withdraw from Ukraine and stop fighting.There were 141 votes in favour of the resolution and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote against the resolution: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria.Russia’s Deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy dismissed the UN resolution as “useless”.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter that the UN vote was a “powerful sign of the unflagging global support” for Ukraine.This resolution is a powerful signal of unflagging global support for 🇺🇦.

It sets the perception,” Kuleba told reporters at the UN in New York City after the vote. “It shows who stands where. If resolutions had no impact Russia would not be fiercely fighting against them.

On that occasion, 35 countries abstained and five, including Russia, voted against it.Russia managed to secure support from Eritrea and Mali – two countries that had abstained in the October vote.But Honduras, Lesotho, Thailand and South Sudan all decided to back the resolution after abstaining last time around.Some of the General Assembly’s 193 members were absent for Thursday’s vote, which followed a lengthy debate during which Russia called the resolution “unbalanced and anti-Russian” and its ally Belarus tried to put through  text amendments including the “prevention of further escalation of the conflict through feeding the parties with lethal weapons.”That is a view being echoed by China, which abstained in the vote and whose officials have spent much of this week criticising the mostly Western countries that have provided military support and weaponry for Ukraine.On Thursday, China’s UN Deputy Ambassador Dai Bing told the UN General Assembly that the “brutal facts offer an ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”, and repeated earlier comments from senior Chinese officials that weapons transfers to Ukraine would only add “fuel to the fire”.China is attempting a difficult diplomatic balancing act over the war that has deepened geopolitical rivalries particularly between Russia and western liberal democracies.Beijing has stressed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, but believes all security concerns should be addressed and shares Russian unease over the NATO alliance. The warmth of the two countries’ relationship was on display in Moscow on Wednesday when top diplomat Wang Yi met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and held talks with Putin.Other countries that abstained also expressed concern that the intense international division was a major obstacle towards bringing an end to the conflict.“While we support the present resolution’s focus on the principles of the charter and international law, it certainly brings us no closer to laying the foundations for a durable peace and bringing and end to devastation and destruction,” said South Africa’s United Nations Ambassador Mathu Joyini.The votes in the General Assembly have become a barometer of the global mood with action in the 15-member Security Council hampered by the veto held by each of its five permanent members: China, Russia, the US, UK and France.The Council is due to hold a meeting on Ukraine later on Friday.",0.04028,0.31566,4394,10,6,13,2,1

Prolonging and expanding the conflict will only make ordinary people pay an even heftier price,” China’s UN Deputy Ambassador Dai Bing told the UN General Assembly on Thursday.The comments came hours before the General Assembly adoped a resolution calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” and demanding Russia withdraw its troops and stop fighting.The resolution was adopted with 141 votes in favour and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no.Western powers have provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in weapons since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. The United States and NATO have in the past week accused China of considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against such a move. China has dismissed the accusations.Dai was speaking at the UN a day after China’s top diplomat Wang Yi visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership with Russia. China and Russia announced a “no limits” partnership shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.The European Union’s top foreign affairs official Josep Borrell met with Wang in Munich last week. He said he asked Wang about the possibility of Chinese military support for Russia.“He was very clear and assertive,” Borrell told reporters at the UN on Thursday, noting that the pair have had a good personal relationship for many years.“I can only repeat what he told me: China is not providing arms for Russia and it will not provide arms to Russia because it’s part of their foreign policy not to arm parties in a conflict,” he said. “We have to remain vigilant.”China’s Ambassador Dai said, “We stand ready to continue playing a constructive role in resolving the Ukraine crisis, and bring about peace at an early date.”Since Moscow invaded its neighbour, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted that Russia could use a nuclear weapon if threatened.“Nuclear weapons cannot be used, nuclear war cannot be fought,” Dai said. “All parties should join together against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear proliferation and avoid a nuclear crisis.”(Al Jazeera)‘Not broken’Meanwhile, Group of Seven ministers discussed new sanctions on Russia and the White House said it will announce “sweeping” new sanctions.As Western leaders promised to step up their support for Kyiv on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to keep up the fight.“We have not broken down, we have overcome many ordeals and we will prevail,” Zelenskyy said on social media. “We will hold to account all those who brought this evil, this war to our land.”‘More weapons and quicker’The prime ministers of Poland and Denmark said after meeting in Copenhagen that Western European countries should be faster and more generous in supplying Ukraine with weapons.“I would like them to be exactly like Denmark and Poland. A longer version is to be more generous in terms of weapon delivery and more quick,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters.Poland, a key ally of Ukraine, has been instrumental in convincing European allies to donate heavy gear to Ukraine, including tanks, a move opposed by several countries until recently.“Let’s be frank. If not for the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom, probably Ukraine would not have survived the first couple of weeks or the first couple of months,” Morawiecki said. “It’s just strengthening the NATO alliance. Some sceptical countries should no longer be sceptical.”Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Morawiecki and his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen stressed the urgency of delivering support to Kyiv as Europe could not allow Ukraine to be defeated.“We need to be aware that we don’t have a lot of time. So we need to speed up our financial support, our military help, we need more donations and we need to work very closely together to make sure they have the capacities they need,” Frederiksen said.Sweden is preparing to send Ukraine the advanced Archer artillery system, but support in the Swedish parliament has been growing to additionally contribute some of the country’s around 120 Leopard tanks.“We are open to that and we are in close dialogue with above all Germany about it,” Swedish Minister of Defence Pal Jonson was quoted by TT as saying.Spain to send tanksElsewhere in Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the government will consider supplying Ukraine with four more Leopard 2 A4 tanks in addition to the six ones already promised. The decision will be made “in the coming weeks,” he added.The first group of Ukrainian troops is already being trained on the use of Leopard 2 tanks in Spain, Sanchez said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyy in Kyiv.According to Sanchez, Spain aims to “synchronise the delivery of the Leopards with the finalisation of the training”.“Ukraine has never posed any threat to Russia; we are helping a country that is defending its people that were attacked,” emphasised the prime minister. “We must understand that Putin violates all fundamental laws, violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Therefore, this struggle is absolutely legal, it must receive our joint assistance.”It was Sanchez’s second visit to Ukraine since Moscow started its all-out war against the country.United States President Joe Biden, right, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talk during Biden’s recent unannounced visit in Kyiv, Ukraine [File: Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP]Germany calls for coordinationRegarding the question of whether to arm Ukraine with warplanes, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said this “currently makes no sense”.His comments came in an interview with ZDF public television, in which he was asked to address growing calls for Western powers to supply arms.Scholz, who earlier faced criticism for perceived foot-dragging over sending Ukraine tanks, said other countries’ difficulties in meeting Ukraine’s demands vindicated his decision to move in lockstep with them.In January, Germany agreed to send, and allow other countries to send, heavy battle tanks to help Ukraine in a potential offensive against Russian troops in its east. Despite this, deliveries have been slow because of donors’ limited supplies.“Maybe this is an indication of why it’s so important to coordinate with each other, with the US, for example, and to prepare these decisions carefully so they work,” Scholz said.Ukraine is now asking for warplanes, though Germany does not have any of the F-16 fighters that have been mentioned in this context.Speaking on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Scholz said he feared that the conflict could become “a very long-lasting war”, but added that Germany and the west would support Ukraine for as long as needed.Russian President Vladimir Putin would eventually have to understand that his war aims – which Scholz noted had several times been revised down since the start of the conflict – were unachievable.Scholz, who will head to India on Saturday in a bid to rally support for Ukraine against Russia, said he was not deterred by signs that many large, emerging countries were reluctant to condemn Russia.“There are only a few countries on Russia’s side,” he said.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.07828,0.37059,8328,22,12,21,3,4
24,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/23/nato-chief-sees-signs-china-considering-supplying-arms-to-russia,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has seen signs that China is considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any move to provide military assistance to Moscow.The comments on Thursday came days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned China of consequences if it provided material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Blinken told news outlet CBS.Blinken clarified that he was referring to weapons and ammunition, but did not say what type of weapons.“It is the US, not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,” shot back Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin the following day. “The US is in no position to tell China what to do.”United States President Joe Biden had warned Chinese President Xi Jinping of “consequences” should Beijing offer Moscow “material support” on March 18 last year.“We haven’t seen any supplies of lethal aid from China to Russia, but we have seen signs that they are considering and may be planning for that,” Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview.“That’s the reason why the United States and other allies have been very clear, warning against that. And China should of course not support Russia’s illegal war,” he added.There was no immediate comment from China, but its foreign ministry said earlier on Thursday that any potential intelligence on arms transfers by China to Russia that the US plans to release was speculation.Russia and China’s relationship came under focus on Wednesday as Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow, hailing the importance of the two countries’ cooperation.Noting the escalation in international tensions, Putin said that “in this context, cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the global arena is particularly important for stabilising the international situation”.Ties between the two had reached “new frontiers”, he said, confirming that Chinese President Xi Jinping might soon travel to Moscow for a summit. The two men have met dozens of times since Xi became president.Beijing has not condemned Moscow over the war, although the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”, took place shortly after Xi and Putin met in China and affirmed a “no limits” partnership.The West has been wary of China’s response to the Ukraine war, with some officials warning that a Russian victory would colour China’s actions toward Taiwan. China has not condemned the conflict in Ukraine or called it an “invasion”.Stoltenberg said China was a member of the United Nations Security Council and that Russia’s war against Ukraine violated the UN Charter.“The basic principle of that charter is to respect the integrity of other nations and not to march in and invade another country with hundreds of thousands of troops,” he said. “Of course, China should not be part of that.”China has said it will outline its position on how to settle the Ukraine conflict through political means in an upcoming paper – one which, according to Russian state media reports, will be published on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s “special military operation”.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that although he had not seen any Chinese peace plan as yet, he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China.",0.01831,0.27979,3583,6,11,12,3,1
25,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/23/as-weapons-taboos-fell-kyiv-and-the-west-became-committed-allies,"Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine a year ago insisting that he was reclaiming a historic part of Russia. The war that ensued was, in his terms, a civil war among Russians.It was also largely a civil war among Soviet-era systems.In a war in which both sides relied on Russian ammunition and systems, Russia had the clear resupply advantage.The West’s determination to prop up Ukraine’s arsenal meant that it had to transition Ukraine to Western systems.European Council President Charles Michel recently described what an unprecedented decision this was for Europe.“When [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy called me on February 24th, he said, ‘Charles, we need weapons. We need ammunition.’ Three days later, we formally decided to provide – for the first time in EU history – lethal equipment to a third country,” Michel told the Ukrainian parliament on January 19.But that created a dilemma.How far and how fast should the West go in opposing Russia in a proxy war – especially one few people at the outset felt Ukraine could win?According to Russian principles on nuclear deterrence, Moscow may retaliate if it is targeted with a nuclear attack or may use nuclear arms if a conventional assault “threatens the very existence of the state”.“[Russian] doctrine is that it will use nuclear weapons to de-escalate when the war is escalating and not going well,” said Colonel Dale Buckner, a former United States special forces commander with extensive intelligence experience who now runs Global Guardian, a multinational security consultancy.“In order to de-escalate, [the Russians] will escalate using chemical or nuclear weapons,” Buckner told Al Jazeera. “It’s a written document. That is the Russian protocol, which then puts fear in everybody.”Russia’s nuclear threat abated towards last autumn as India and China, its nuclear-armed allies, discouraged any nuclear reprisals.But in the meantime, Russia played on Western fears.An incremental build-up of confidenceThe West moved slowly at first, providing only defensive weapons to Ukraine, but its inhibitions have evaporated due to a series of turning points in the war.The first coincided with the defeat of Russia’s original war aims soon after the war had begun.Ukraine used US-made Javelin missiles to skewer a 65km (40-mile) column of Russian armour as it tried to reach Kyiv.A month into the invasion, Putin withdrew his forces from the northern territories after suffering enormous losses to focus on the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.NATO then sent anti-ship Neptune missiles, which Ukraine used to sink the Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva on April 24, pushing back other Russian ships 100km (62 miles) from Ukrainian shores.The second turning point came in response to Russia’s high-intensity warfare in Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas region.“Russian artillery were firing around 20,000 rounds per day, with their peak fire rate surpassing 32,000 rounds on some days,” a report by the Royal United Services Institute said. “Ukrainian fires rarely exceeded 6,000 rounds a day, reflecting a shortage of both barrels and ammunition.”In April, allies for the first time provided armoured personnel carriers, long-range howitzer artillery and Phoenix Ghost kamikaze drones. M113 armoured personnel carriers and Mastiff heavily armoured patrol vehicles were the first Western-designed and -built armour to go to Ukraine.Guided artillery rockets turn the warIn one of the most consequential decisions of the war, US President Joe Biden on May 30 approved sending High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, a GPS-guided multiple rocket launch system with three times the range of field artillery and an accuracy of two metres (2.2 yards) at 80km (50 miles).HIMARS arrived in Ukraine on June 23, and two days later, Ukraine put it to devastating use, targeting Russian command posts and ammunition depots far behind the front lines in what Australian Brigadier General Mick Ryan called a “strategy of corrosion”.After the US decision, Britain and Germany readied European adaptations of HIMARS with twice the firepower. The M270 entered into service on July 15 and the MARS II on August 1.By late July, Kherson administrative adviser Sergey Khlan said “a breakthrough has occurred in the course of hostilities. We see that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have begun counteroffensive actions in the Kherson region.”By destroying Russian supply lines and warehouses, Ukraine neutralised the main Russian advantage – firepower. Moscow was forced to draw its depots back into Russia and turn to Belarus and North Korea for more ammunition.In the first week of September, Ukrainian forces were able to launch counteroffensives in the southern region of Kherson and the northern region of Kharkiv almost simultaneously, winning back territory.Moscow Calling, a Russian military reporter, called the effect of HIMARS and similar systems “colossal”.“Russia goes into a defensive posture, and everyone starts to realise the Russians have real problems,” Buckner said. “‘We can pin Russia’ is what a lot of people are thinking.”Tanks and the problem with GermanyUkraine’s ability to take back half the land Russia had occupied at the beginning of the year encouraged thoughts of offensive weapons.“The tank is a weapon of assault and attack and advance. … They’re not defensive,” Chris Yates, a retired British tank commander with battlefield experience on the Challenger 2, told Al Jazeera.“It’s symbolic that the West supports a Ukraine going into the assault, hitting back against Russia, not just minimising or containing a Russian advance,” Yates said.Europe’s most widely used tank is the Leopard 2, built by Germany, which needed to authorise its re-export from its allies to Ukraine, but Germany’s resistance to first-mover status was never overcome. Britain had to commit Challenger 2 tanks and the US M1 Abrams tanks for Germany to agree to allow NATO allies to export Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine on January 25.Allies have so far promised 223 Western main battle tanks, marking a fifth turning point in the war.A sixth came on February 3, when the US agreed to supply Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB), giving Ukraine twice the striking range of HIMARS.Will the fellowship hold?There are practical concerns to this military aid.Ukraine is rapidly depleting its allies’ reserves of NATO artillery shells, and defence industries need time to ramp up production.“States [are] either hiring local or foreign workers, adding production lines, building new plants, especially in Eastern Europe, all to increase productivity, which combined will in time make a difference, but the time it will take to reach and sustain the levels of ammunition that Ukraine is using – I have a fear that it might not be enough,” said Elisabeth Gosselin Malo, a Canadian defence correspondent.The US announced in January that it was increasing shell production sixfold to 90,000 a month, but that will happen over a two-year period, Malo said.“Defence manufacturers are being for the most part transparent about the numbers they’re hoping to reach, but the inventory that states have is completely off the record, so there’s not really a way for us to verify if they are in a position to sustain this for another year,” Malo told Al Jazeera.An unnamed senior White House official told The Washington Post that Ukraine might not enjoy current levels of support indefinitely, a reference to declining Republican support for Ukraine in Congress.Others dismiss those political concerns.“No matter what the rhetoric is on the far right, … I think we’re all in here, and we’re going as if Putin is going all in and this is going to be going on for a few more years,” Buckner said. “… That’s the mentality in [the US Department of Defense] right now.”“The US is going to do what it does well – we throw money at problems,” he said, a reference to the $112bn the US Congress approved last year in aid to Ukraine.“We are ramping up to be sustainable and get our stockpiles [up] not only to support the Ukraine in the long haul but also fight a kinetic war in Asia” he said.",0.05232,0.32632,8148,23,16,29,3,1
26,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/23/putin-says-russia-to-deploy-sarmat-nuclear-missiles-this-year,"President Vladimir Putin has said the delayed Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile will be deployed this year, in comments made on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.The RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fuelled missile – dubbed Satan 2 by Western analysts – was first announced by Putin in 2018 and was supposed to have been deployed last year.CNN reported that the United States believes Russia carried out a test of the Sarmat just before US President Joe Biden visited Ukraine earlier this week, but that the test failed. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on that report.The 35-metre (115 feet) missile, which Putin says will make Russia’s enemies “think twice”, has a range of 18,000km (11,185 miles). Some estimate this to be higher. It can carry at least 10 multiple targetable re-entry vehicles – each with a nuclear warhead – which can each be aimed at a different target. It can also deliver hypersonic Avangard glide vehicles that can travel further and faster, flying in an unpredictable path to spoof missile defences.“We pay special attention, as before, to strengthening the nuclear triad. This year, the first launchers of the Sarmat missile system will be put on combat duty,” Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin on Thursday to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland Day”, known in Soviet times as Red Army Day.Last June, Putin had also said the missile would be deployed by the end of 2022.A year since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control – including the big powers’ moratorium on nuclear testing – unless the West backs off in Ukraine.During a state of the nation address on Tuesday, Putin said Russia would be suspending its participation in the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms pact with the US. But Moscow later said it would still comply with the treaty until it expires in early 2026.In his address on Thursday, Putin also said Russia would continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles.“With the adoption of the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine project Emperor Alexander III into the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100 percent,” Putin said.“In the coming years, three more cruisers of this project will replenish the fleet’s combat strength,” he said.The Emperor Alexander III was launched in late December. It is the seventh Borei-A class submarine – which can each carry 16 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles.Putin also said Russia would develop all parts of its conventional armed forces, improve training, add advanced equipment, bolster the arms industry and promote soldiers who had proven themselves in battle.“A modern, efficient army and navy are a guarantee of the country’s security and sovereignty, a guarantee of its stable development and its future,” Putin said.“Therefore, we will continue to pay priority attention to strengthening our defence capability.”On February 24, 2022, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine as part of a so-called “special military operation” for what they thought would be a rapid victory.But Ukraine has fought back doggedly, with the war dragging on into a deadlock that has killed thousands of civilians and caused an estimated 150,000 casualties on both sides, according to various Western sources.",0.04435,0.29765,3490,6,2,8,11,0
27,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/23/ukraine-war-shifts-global-power-relations-as-china-asserts-role,"The Ukraine war began to visibly affect international relationships in the 52nd week of the conflict, as Washington declared Russian President Vladimir Putin a failure, Moscow revived nuclear threats and China assumed a more assertive posture towards the United States.A year after Russian troops poured into Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, a prelude to Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv and declared that the Russian president had failed.“He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were soft,” Biden said in a speech delivered later that day on Polish soil.“And then, he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force.Biden upheld Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a worthy adversary to Putin, who has refused to acknowledge Zelenskyy as an equal.“[Putin] found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel: President Zelenskyy.”Biden concluded, “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.”Biden’s visit to Kyiv, which is still part of a war zone, was fraught with risk, but loaded with symbolism. Biden and Zelenskyy were filmed and photographed walking in the centre of the city.Biden and Zelenskyy walk next to Saint Michael’s cathedral in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 20, 2023 [File: Gleb Garanich/Reuters]Putin spoke for two hours the following day to justify his invasion.“A year ago, in order to protect people on our historical lands, to ensure the security of our country, to eliminate the threat that came from the neo-Nazi regime that developed in Ukraine after the 2014 coup, a decision was made to conduct a special military operation,” said Putin, referring to the Maidan Revolution that unseated Ukraine’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovich.“We did everything possible, indeed everything possible, to solve this problem by peaceful means,” said Putin. He has held that Russia can never be secure with Ukraine as a NATO member on its border. NATO began Ukraine’s membership process in 2008.Consistent with his past statements, Putin painted the West as neocolonial and aggressive.“The concepts of honour, trust, decency are not for them. Over the long centuries of colonialism, diktat, hegemony, they got used to being allowed everything, got used to spitting on the whole world.”A US-China proxy war?More ominously, China is now thinking of supplying Russia with weapons, said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Blinken told CBS.Blinken clarified that he was referring to weapons and ammunition, but did not say what type of weapons.“It is the US, not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,” shot back Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin the following day. “The US is in no position to tell China what to do.”Biden had warned Chinese President Xi Jinping of “consequences” should Beijing offer Moscow “material support” on March 18 last year.Xi has been navigating a careful line.In June, he was critical of the US, calling on the world to “reject the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, oppose unilateral sanctions and abuse of sanctions, and reject the small circles built around hegemonism”, references to the economic sanctions the US has imposed on China and Russia.But in September, Xi told Putin he had “questions and concerns” about the war, and spoke of the need to “inject stability” into world affairs.He was even more reproachful of Putin the following month when he and Biden met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia.“The international community should … jointly oppose the use or threats to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, in order to prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia,” Xi said.Meanwhile, Russia cultivated fears of nuclear war.As early as April, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned of the risk of a third world war.“I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it,” he said on Russian state television.Putin returned to the tactic of implying nuclear escalation during his February 21 speech.“I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty,” Putin said, referring to the New START treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads the US and Russia can deploy.He did not announce a full withdrawal from the treaty, which was renewed in 2021 for five years.During his speech, Putin called on the state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, to be ready to resume nuclear weapons testing.Instead of reprimanding Putin this time, China rewarded him with a visit by top diplomat Wang Yi the following day, apparently a forerunner to a state visit by Xi.“We await a visit of the President of the People’s Republic of China to Russia, we have agreed on this,” Putin told Wang. “Everything is progressing, developing. We are reaching new frontiers,” Putin said.China’s decision to draw closer to Russia in its hour of need could realign global relationships fundamentally.Russia has so far presented itself as being in a contest with the US, which has provided Ukraine with much of the weaponry that keeps it fighting.(Al Jazeera)Should China become Russia’s weapons provider, it could introduce a symmetry, in which the US and China were each sponsoring a champion in this war. That might be calculated to elevate China to the status of an alternative superpower to the US, but it would likely demote Russia.There were further ominous international developments surrounding the Ukraine war.The Kyiv Post and other media broke the news of a 17-page strategy document they say details “Russia’s plans to subjugate Belarus and dismantle its independence”.According to the document, Belarus must have a full currency union with Russia by 2030. Its media should be under Moscow’s state control, and key military industries would have to move to Russia. The ultimate goal would be to declare a Union State comprising Russia and Belarus – something akin to the USSR.",0.02023,0.37155,6419,11,16,23,15,5

The US and other Western countries have voiced concerns over China providing material support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, the largest land conflict in Europe since World War Two.In a national address, Putin also said Russia will “pay increased attention to strengthening” land, air and sea nuclear capabilities.A senior defence official said Russia will stick to agreed limits on nuclear missiles and keep informing the US about changes in its deployments, despite the suspension of the New START treaty – its last remaining arms control treaty with Washington.Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukraine of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region in a false flag operation, the RIA news agency reported.Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda said he urged Biden to seek NATO deployment of additional military equipment, such as HIMARS artillery or attack helicopters, in the Baltic states.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced Russia’s invasion as a violation of the founding UN Charter and international law, and called out Moscow’s threats about the possible use of nuclear weapons, saying: “It is high time to step back from the brink.”Ukraine’s First Lady Olena Zelenska called on the UN to establish a special tribunal to prosecute crimes of Russian aggression, stressing that “it is not only us who need that, we need that for everyone”.The UN General Assembly was set to vote on Thursday on a resolution calling for “just and lasting peace in Ukraine”, the latest opportunity for countries to lodge an official position on the conflict.European Union countries could not reach an agreement on Wednesday about new sanctions against Russia, and planned more talks to have the package ready for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, diplomats said.FightingTwo civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine and two were wounded in a missile strike on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, regional officials said.The head of the Wagner Russian mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, took a bitter public feud with the army top brass to a new level, publishing a grisly image of dozens of his fighters he said had been killed after being deprived of ammunition.Russian prosecutors said they were proceeding with a case against exiled science fiction writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, accused of publishing “false information” about Russian atrocities in the war.Ukrainian forces repelled 90 Russian attacks in the northeast and east over the past 24 hours, the military said early on Thursday. Russian troops attacked near Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region and around Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Shakhtarsk in the Donetsk region, where, according to the Ukrainian military, Russia is concentrating its offensive efforts.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.03125,0.27655,3962,6,4,17,2,0
29,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/23/wang-yi-meets-putin-in-sign-of-deepening-china-russia-ties,"The warmth of Russia’s and China’s relationship has been on display in the Kremlin as President Vladimir Putin held talks with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi and hailed the importance of the two countries’ cooperation.Images showed Wang and Putin exchanging a firm handshake and sitting across the table from each other during their meeting on Wednesday. Others showed Wang, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, looking relaxed as he walked with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Wang’s visit to Moscow – at the end of a tour of a number of European countries – comes nearly a year after Putin ordered troops into neighbouring Ukraine, starting a conflict that has left thousands dead, forced millions to flee and left Ukrainian towns and cities in ruins.The war has also widened divisions between Russia and the world’s liberal democracies, mostly in the West, which are backing Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Moscow. Ties between China and the United States are also under serious strain.Noting the escalation in international tensions, Putin said that “in this context, cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the global arena is particularly important for stabilising the international situation”.Ties between the two had reached “new frontiers”, he said, confirming that Chinese President Xi Jinping might soon travel to Moscow for a summit. The two men have met dozens of times since Xi became Chinese president.Beijing has not condemned Moscow over the war although the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”, took place shortly after Xi and Putin met in China and affirmed a “no limits” partnership.The US and NATO have recently expressed concern that China might provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, although China has denied having any such plan.Wang emphasised that Moscow and Beijing both support “multipolarity and democratisation of international relations” – a reference to their shared goal of countering the perceived US dominance in global affairs.“Chinese-Russian relations aren’t directed against any third countries and certainly can’t be subject to pressure from any third countries,” he said.Before meeting Putin, Wang Yu (left) met the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (right) with Wang stressing deepening ties between the two countries [Alexander Nemenov/Pool Photo via AP Photo]Earlier on Wednesday, Wang held talks with Russia’s foreign minister. “Our ties have continued to develop dynamically and despite high turbulence in the global arena, we have shown the readiness to speak in defence of each other’s interests,” Lavrov said.Wang responded in kind, underlining Beijing’s focus on deepening ties with Russia. Russia’s foreign ministry said there was no discussion about a purported Chinese peace plan for Ukraine.China has echoed Moscow’s claim that the US and NATO are to blame for the conflict by “provoking” the Kremlin.Russia, in turn, has staunchly supported China amid tensions with the US over Taiwan and other issues, such as in the northwestern Xinjiang region, where the United Nations has found crimes against humanity might have been committed.Still, some analysts say while China has emphasised its close ties with Moscow, it is also wary of escalating tensions with the West when it needs to boost its economy after the prolonged lockdowns of its now-defunct zero-COVID policy.“Isolation from the West is not something (Beijing) wants to risk,” Yu Jie, a senior research fellow for China in the Asia-Pacific programme at Chatham House, a United Kingdom think tank, said in comments published on Wednesday.“President Xi and his colleagues have begun to realise that cooperation with Russia comes with substantial limits to avoid undermining China’s own political priorities and longer-term economic interests.”The war in Ukraine began on February 24 last year and has become the biggest land conflict in Europe since World War Two.At a meeting on Wednesday of the 193-member UN General Assembly to mark the first anniversary of the war, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Russia’s invasion as a violation of the UN Charter and international law.The General Assembly is set to vote later on Thursday on a resolution put forward by Ukraine and supporters, stressing “the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in line with the UN Charter.Guterres said the Charter was “unambiguous”, citing from it: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”Ukraine and its supporters hope to deepen Russia’s diplomatic isolation by securing the support of nearly three-quarters of the assembly to match – if not better – the support received for several resolutions last year.Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzya, told the assembly that Moscow had been left with “no other option” but to ensure “the safety and security of our country, using military means”.",0.02765,0.25541,5084,6,9,15,6,0
30,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/22/wagner-chief-mercenaries-slaughtered-because-of-shell-hunger,"The increasingly vitriolic owner of the Russian mercenary firm the Wagner Group hit out at Russia’s military elite by publishing a grim image of dozens of his fighters he said were killed after being deprived of ammunition while battling Ukrainian troops.Yevgeny Prigozhin – founder of the Wagner private military company that is fighting on Moscow’s behalf in Ukraine – took a bitter public feud with the top army brass to a new level on Wednesday with the grisly photograph of corpses piled high, while laying blame for their deaths squarely with the top army brass.“This is one of the places where the bodies of those who have died are gathered,” Prigozhin told a prominent Russian military blogger in an interview.“These are guys who died yesterday because of so-called [artillery] ‘shell hunger’. Mothers, wives and children will get their bodies. There should be five times less [dead]. Who is guilty that they died? The guilty ones are those who should have resolved the question of us getting enough ammo.”Wagner’s chief repeatedly accused the Russian defence ministry this week of deliberately starving his fighters of munitions in what he called a treasonous attempt to destroy the mercenary group.The defence ministry, in a statement late on Tuesday, said such allegations were “completely untrue” and complained – without mentioning Prigozhin by name – about attempts to create splits that worked “solely to the benefit of the enemy”.Undeterred, Prigozhin doubled down on his allegations, taking the unusual step of releasing the image of dozens of his dead fighters laying prostrate on the icy ground in eastern Ukraine, where Wagner is battling to try to take the small Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.It appears the Wagner boss’ public tirade achieved results. Prigozhin said on Thursday his troops had begun receiving additional supplies of ammunition after the row with Russia’s top army brass.“Today at 6am, it was announced that the shipment of ammunition has started,” Prigozhin said in a statement on Telegram. “Most likely the ball is now rolling. So far it’s all on paper but, as we were told, the principal documents have already been signed.”Prigozhin earlier released a copy of what he said was Wagner’s official request to the defence ministry for ammunition, with detailed tallies of shells used, requested and received – though he said he blanked out sensitive data such as the names of the shells.“They’re still not giving us ammo. No steps to give us ammo have been taken,” said Prigozhin, alleging Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff, were withholding their signatures from shell approval forms.Neither man has publicly responded to Prigozhin’s criticism in the past.Prigozhin, a wealthy catering tycoon, has assumed a more public role since the war started. But he has faced pushback from the authorities in recent weeks amid signs of a move by the Kremlin and defence ministry to rein in his growing influence.On Wednesday, he said he launched a social media campaign to try to secure artillery shells, adding Wagner had been reduced to begging military warehouses for ammunition, which he said was sometimes successful.Despite the purported shortage, he said his fighters would keep trying to overrun Ukraine’s Bakhmut.“Twice as many of us are going to die that’s all, until there are none of us left,” he said. “And when Wagner are all dead then Shoigu and Gerasimov will probably have to pick up a gun.”",0.01335,0.41997,3525,3,2,5,1,0
31,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/22/russian-official-says-nuclear-war-no-closer-despite-treaty-move,"Moscow’s decision to suspend its participation in the New START arms reduction treaty with the United States does not increase the risk of a nuclear conflict, Russia’s deputy foreign minister says.Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday it would be up to Russian President Vladimir Putin to determine whether Moscow could return to the pact, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.His comments came after Putin announced on Tuesday he is freezing Moscow’s participation in the treaty, raising fears the nearly yearlong conflict in Ukraine could yet escalate into a global nuclear war.But Ryabkov poured cold water on those concerns.“I do not believe the decision to suspend the New START Treaty brings us closer to nuclear war,” he said.The agreement is the last major pillar of post-Cold War nuclear arms control between Russia and the US, and limits their strategic nuclear arsenals.Russia’s foreign and defence ministries have said Moscow will continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in New START on the number of nuclear warheads it can deploy and the number of nuclear missile carriers.But Washington lamented Putin’s move nonetheless, with US President Joe Biden on Wednesday calling it a “big mistake” as he headed into a meeting with leaders of NATO’s eastern flank in Warsaw.Russia, China eye ‘deeper’ tiesThe meeting in the Polish capital came as China pledged to deepen cooperation with Russia, highlighting growing geopolitical tensions as the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches.Making the highest-level visit to Russia by a Chinese official since the countries signed a “no limits” partnership weeks before Moscow launched its attack, top diplomat Wang Li told Putin that Beijing is ready to enhance ties.A time of crisis required Russia and China “to continuously deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership“, Wang said during a meeting at the Kremlin.Putin, for his part, said he was looking forward to a visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming months and a deeper partnership with Beijing.The meeting between China’s top diplomat Wang Li (left) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) came after the US said earlier this week that China is weighing supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia [Sputnik/Anton Novoderezhkin via Reuters]‘Responsible power’Xi is expected to make a “peace speech” on Friday – exactly a year since tens of thousands of Russian troops funneled into Ukraine from the north, south and east. Kyiv says there can be no talk of peace while Moscow’s forces remain in the country.Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said China is keen to “project itself forward as a mediator and responsible power”.“While Beijing wants the conflict in Ukraine to end, it does not want to see a weakened Russia or a weakened Putin,” Yu said, pointing out that China receives several benefits from friendly relations with Moscow.“It gets stable access to cheap oil and gas, it gets a peaceful northern border, and [it gets] a friend in its corner to counterweigh the US and US allies.”Meanwhile, European Union countries failed to agree on new sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, diplomatic sources in Brussels said.The proposed package features trade curbs worth more than 10 billion euros ($10.6bn), according to the bloc’s chief executive, and also includes a ban on EU imports of Russian rubber.Putin hails ‘heroic’ Russian troopsLater on Wednesday, Putin delivered a second combative speech in as many days to a patriotic concert at a Moscow sports arena aimed at rallying public support for Russia’s bloody offensive.He hailed Russian troops as “heroic” and said they were fighting for the country’s “historic frontiers” and to protect its “interests, people, culture, language and territory”.“When we are together we have no equal,” Putin shouted to enthusiastic crowds at the Glory to Defenders of the Fatherland event, held on the eve of Russia’s February 23 holiday celebrating those who serve in the armed forces.Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Moscow, said Putin had been keen to emphasise that Russia stands “united and steadfast” in the face of sweeping Western sanctions and military support for Ukraine.“This has been the theme [from Putin] in the last 24 hours … that the Western alliance has not been able to break Russia,” he said, citing the Russian president’s lengthy state-of-the-nation address on Tuesday.In his annual “State of the Nation” address, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the West for starting the war in Ukraine, which Russia invaded one year ago this week ⤵️🟠 LIVE updates https://t.co/531GHXnaRv pic.twitter.com/xQL0hKgr56— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) February 21, 2023",0.10263,0.30049,4805,7,8,25,13,0
32,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/22/all-of-ukraine-is-a-battlefield-lessons-about-modern-war,"The lessons of the Ukraine war are still being debated and assessed.After all, there still is no official winner in this conflict.But the war has clearly accelerated certain military trends, experts have said, indicating how future wars will be fought.The information warSocial media is perhaps the greatest innovation in this war.The internet has been replete with videos of Russian armour being destroyed by Ukrainian operatives, an underdog narrative amplified repeatedly by official Ukrainian channels.In one audacious video, a Ukrainian drone operator suspends a bomb from his aerial vehicle with a piece of string as it hovers over a Russian tank, until he lowers it into an open hatch and it detonates.Other footage shows drones dropping grenades into trenches where Russian troops think they are safe, killing them.“We have learned how to attach small grenades and bombs to [drones]. Now, we can send up a small $3,000 Mavik 3 with a $30 grenade – and if you drop it perfectly on a T-90 you can take out a tank that costs millions,” a Ukrainian soldier recently told a Western reporter.The psychological effect of showing Russians what will happen to them if they enlist in the armed forces is an aspect of what military officers call hybrid war, and it has clearly had an effect.When Russian President Vladimir Putin embarked on a mobilisation of 300,000 new troops last September, he also triggered an exodus of three times as many Russians.The Russian interior ministry recently said it had issued 5.4 million passports last year, a 40 percent increase on the year before, and was suspending new applications because it had run out of the electronic chips embedded in the passports.“The Kremlin need not look further than passport statistics to poll domestic attitudes on the Russian population’s desire to fight Putin’s war,” said the Institute for the Study of War.Such statistics, along with Ukraine’s videos, belie the Russian official narrative that it will win, or that society supports this war.The march of weaponsBut the drone videos also make a point about evolving military tactics.“Instead of sending out people to do reconnaissance … you now throw up drones and have a perfect situational awareness,” said Dale Buckner, a US former special forces commander with many reconnaissance patrols under his belt.He now runs Global Guardian, a multinational security consultancy.“Then you fix [the target], and with long-range missiles and modern [High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems], you don’t need a platoon, company or battalion or brigade to go execute raids and offensive attacks in the way you might have in the past,” he told Al Jazeera.This economy of manpower has favoured the weaker side – Ukraine – and demonstrated the increasing power of precise weapons.Last July, Ukraine’s ministry of digital transformation started training civilian drone operators in flying and cloaking skills. This Army of Drones, using both Ukrainian-donated off-the-shelf drones and US-supplied military unmanned aerial vehicles, would deploy to the front lines to boost surveillance and targeting of Russian assets. This year, Ukraine’s general staff went further, saying they were forming the world’s first UAV strike companies.France seems to have taken the lesson to heart, as well.Last month, it announced an imminent reorganisation of its armed forces to reduce tanks and infantry regiments and reinforce drones and cyber-warfare.The Javelin anti-tank missile, meanwhile, demonstrated the growing power of relatively inexpensive weapons to level an unequal battlefield.And in July, when Ukraine fielded High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) – GPS-guided missiles with high accuracy at 80km (50-mile) range – it decimated artillery ammunition depots as well as armour.“Our fear at the beginning of the war was that Putin’s ironclad armies would steamroll over Ukraine, but this didn’t happen,” said Andreas Iliopoulos, a lieutenant-general who recently retired as deputy commander of the Hellenic Army.“The Javelin and other similar weapons exterminated tanks. That’s a new kind of war. We couldn’t have predicted that,” he told Al Jazeera.Tank casualty figures after a year of fighting demonstrate just how deadly these weapons have proven. At the time of writing, the current documented tally of destroyed Russian armour stands at 5,924, of which 1,038 are tanks.Ukraine has lost 1,895, of which 279 are tanks.Iliopoulos believes this is the beginning of a new trend in warfare.“The battle tank is finished in terms of the influence it used to wield. Huge battles involving tank formations will not happen again,” he said.Ukraine seems to have accelerated a trend that was visible earlier.Mass still mattersOthers warn against discounting tanks, putting Russian failings down to poor command.“Tanks as a concept have to be part of combined arms operations, which means they have to work … in combination with artillery and air support, reconnaissance and artillery,” said Chris Yates, a retired tank commander who fought in the second Gulf war.“The Russians absolutely failed to use combined arms tactics – all these clustered convoys on roads and all these tanks driving around without any proper support – I think that’s why they failed initially,” Yates told Al Jazeera, pointing out that Ukraine is asking for more of them from its allies.An analysis of the opening days of the invasion by the Royal United Services Institute concluded that the main thrust of Russian forces from the north towards Kyiv was “intended as a demonstration of power” and “not anticipating heavy fighting”.“Many Russian soldiers arrived in towns without their weapons loaded … [and would] begin to try to engage with the civilian population to understand where they were. Their position would be reported and the Russian unit would be engaged with artillery,” the RUSI report said.Not anticipating resistance, the Russian forces did not bring enough fuel or maintenance supplies and had to abandon many of their tanks.“I don’t think anyone should predict the end of armour. What’s happening is the battlefield is becoming more lethal for all weapons systems, including tanks,” said Panayotis Gartzonikas, a former armoured division commander in the Hellenic Army and lecturer at Greece’s National Defence College.“Movement has become more difficult. Anything that moves is struck. The battlefield has become transparent,” Gartzonikas told Al Jazeera, but he insisted that the tank is irreplaceable. “The speed, manoeuvrability, protection and firepower of the tank is not matched by any other system,” he said.‘The whole of Ukraine has become a battlefield’Gartzonikas also believed the Ukraine war has put all of society at war.“The battlefield is not linear – you can’t say, ‘These are our friends on this side and these are our foes on the other’,” he said. “It’s undefined. Effectively, the whole of Ukraine has become a battlefield. The distinction between civilian and military no longer exists. The trend was there, but in this war, it has reached new heights.”The targeting of civilian populations has been perhaps a greater feature of this war than of any other.Last November, Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Russia had fired more than 16,000 missiles at Ukraine, 97 percent of which had landed on civilians.Only about 500 had landed on purely military targets, he said. Approximately 220 had landed on energy infrastructure, but those relatively few had clearly had the greatest impact on the country.Ukraine learned on the job, and fast.Last December, its deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitskyi told Bild that Ukrainian air defences now have a 75-80 percent kill rate for Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, which are notoriously difficult to intercept, and sometimes a 100 percent success rate against kamikaze drones.But as it has so often done in this war, Ukraine also turned adversity to advantage through an information campaign.The pictures of suffering civilians news and social media carried westward brought back hundreds of generators to restore water and power to Ukraine’s cities.More importantly, they brought the West’s most sophisticated air defence systems and sparked debate on whether to send longer-range offensive missiles or fighter jets with which Ukraine could punish Russia for more than 7,000 documented civilian deaths.Perhaps one of the most valuable lessons Ukraine has taught the world about war is an old one: the value of alliances.“While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and the alliance has stopped short of deploying forces to Ukraine, it has demonstrated a resolve that had been absent before now,” wrote retired Major-General Mick Ryan on Substack.Russia ostensibly invaded Ukraine to prevent it from becoming a NATO member.“Ukraine is already an integral part of Euro-Atlantic security,” wrote Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba last October.“We do not yet have Article 5 umbrellas over ourselves,” he said, a reference to the alliance’s mutual defence clause, “but all NATO members are de facto under the umbrella of Ukraine, under the protection of our Armed Forces.”",0.11617,0.34764,9164,25,24,21,3,0

Despite their name, analysts have said the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed – which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads – but manoeuvrability.The weapons are seen as a way to gain an edge over any adversary as they can potentially evade missile shields and early warning systems.Russia is in a race with the United States and China to develop them.South African government criticised over drillsGladkiy’s remarks came precisely halfway through the maritime drills being staged from Durban and Richards Bay, ports in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province.Media coverage of the exercise, which runs until February 27, has been restricted.South Africa has faced domestic criticism for participating.The opposition Democratic Alliance said it shows the government is not neutral in Russia’s war in Ukraine.But the South African National Defence Force says the drills are simply “a multinational maritime exercise”.The naval drills will “strengthen the already flourishing relations between South Africa, Russia and China” with the aim of sharing “operational skills and knowledge”, the military said in a statement.The three countries previously held the Mosi I naval drills in Cape Town, in 2019.South Africa is among many African countries that maintain relations with Moscow and abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine.",0.0904,0.31368,2425,3,4,10,1,0
34,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/22/what-is-the-new-start-nuclear-deal-and-why-did-russia-suspend-it,"President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is suspending participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States after accusing the West of being directly involved in attempts to attack its strategic air bases.“I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty,” he said on Tuesday.What is the New START treaty?START stands for “Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty” and is the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between Russia and the US.The treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the US and Russia can deploy, was signed by former US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev in 2010.It came into force in February 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years after US President Joe Biden took office.Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are committed to the following:Deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers.A limit of 800 intercontinental ballistic missiles in deployment.Each side can conduct up to 18 inspections of strategic nuclear weapons sites yearly to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits.Inspections under the agreement were put on hold in March 2020 because of the COVID pandemic.Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections were due to take place last November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them and neither side has set a new date.Obama and Medvedev sign the New START treaty in Prague in 2010 [File: Jason Reed/Reuters]Why is Russia suspending it?Russia said earlier this month that it wanted to preserve the treaty, despite what it called a destructive US approach to arms control.However, on Tuesday, the Russian foreign ministry blamed the US for the decision to suspend participation, accusing Washington of non-compliance with its provisions and of trying to undermine Russia’s national security.Moscow said the fundamental geopolitical realities underpinning the treaty’s signing had changed.It said the provisions had become one-sided, favouring the US, saying it had found ways to violate its central limits on the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed.Putin emphasised that Russia was only suspending, not terminating, its participation in the treaty.“The decision to suspend participation in New START can be reversed,” the foreign ministry said.“To do this, Washington must show the political will and make good-faith efforts for general de-escalation.“We are convinced that the potential of the treaty in terms of its contribution to strengthening international security and strategic stability is far from exhausted,” it added.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that the Russian move was “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible”.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said it made the world more dangerous and urged Putin to reconsider.What are the implications?The US and Russia have checks to ensure that their nuclear missiles cannot be used accidentally and together account for about 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads.On Tuesday, a US Department of State spokesperson said it was “unclear” if Putin’s move to suspend Russia’s participation in the New START nuclear treaty will have a “practical impact”.“We haven’t seen any reason to change our nuclear posture, our strategic posture just yet,” Ned Price told CNN.Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from Brussels, said Russia’s announcement was probably aimed at an international audience as, while Europe and the US are largely in agreement on support for Ukraine and moves towards negotiations, countries from other regions are more divided over these issues.“That is the difference that Putin was potentially trying to exploit in his speech,” he said.Experts also stressed that Russia is not yet leaving the treaty.“Suspension of the treaty is not equal to leaving the treaty; I assume there will be no Russian build-up above the treaty limits,” Andrey Baklitskiy of the UN Institute for Disarmament Research said on Twitter.“But there will be much fewer opportunities to verify this (only national technical means), so compliance will be disputed,” he added.",-0.00665,0.39691,4237,1,5,17,5,0

Peace seems a distant prospect.Which direction might the war take now?We asked several experts to share their views:‘Ukraine and Russia both don’t have enough arms’Nikolay Mitrokhin, a historian with Germany’s Bremen University:“The basic scenario – neither Russia nor Ukraine can achieve their goals in this war. Russia will hardly be able to even occupy the entire [southeastern region of] Donbas, let alone destroy Ukraine as a nation.“Ukraine won’t be able to get back to the borders of January 2014 [before the annexation of Crimea and Russia’s support to separatists in Donbas].“The war may be over by late 2023 or in 2024 because both sides will have exhausted their resources. The main reasons being that Ukraine and Russia both don’t have enough arms, ammo and servicemen to achieve what they aim for.“I see three concrete scenarios.“The pessimistic one: Russia breaks Ukrainian defences in the north of the current frontline, a crescent that stretches about 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) and occupies [the city of] Lyman. It breaks them in the south [of the frontline] and lays siege to [the city of] Zaporizhzhia.“It breaks them in the centre [of the frontline] and reaches [the towns of] Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, where it storms these towns. Perhaps, after they are taken, Ukraine is offered a stable truce.“The most probable [scenario]: Despite a massive battle in the south [of the frontline], the front there remains stable, Russian forces reach Sloviansk and Kramatorsk but can’t take them. In the north, Russians take Lyman.“The optimistic [scenario]: Ukrainian forces grind Russians on the southern front, conduct a successful operation of paratroopers across the Dnieper River, partially or fully liberate the south of Ukraine.[Courtesy: Nikolay Mitrokhin]“In the north [of the front], they manage to take [the town of] Svatove and reach the rear of the Lysychansk-Severodonetsk agglomeration and after that, Russia withdraws its forces approximately to the line of confrontation of February 24, 2022 – minus, perhaps, the liberated areas in the south. That’s the point where the West is offered a deal – peace in exchange for reparations and keeping Crimea under [Russian] control.“And that’s where an apocalyptic continuation is possible – Ukraine doesn’t agree with that and destroys the Crimean Bridge [across the Strait of Kerch that links the peninsula to Russia] with long-range missiles.“In the absence of civil air flights and the complexity of maritime transportation under Ukrainian drone attacks [Russia’s] control over Crimea becomes very costly and complicated.“And in response to that, Putin may order to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine or to convincingly show the West the possibility of doing it. And then the truce will be made under previous conditions – or under stricter ones on the part of Russia.”‘Victory should be about weakening Russia as an aggressive imperialist state’Lt Gen Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces:“Russian forces began advancing in late January. It’s a very long front – from Kypyansk in the Kharkiv region and then in five directions – Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Adviivka and Shakhtar all the way to Uhledar. That’s more than a thousand kilometres.[Courtesy: Ihor Romanenko]“The enemy has overtaken the initiative on the tactical level and uses the military reserves it has accumulated since late last year. [Russians] are readying their servicemen for operations that will engage the 300,000 people they have mobilised [since September].“They also recruited inmates, by [the] Wagner [private military company], by [its head Yevgeny] Prigozhin, but they have mostly been killed and Wagner has been bled dry.“[Moscow] is training 150-200,000 [mobilised men] on Russian and Belarusian shooting ranges for strategic use and is getting the military equipment ready for them.“Ukraine’s forces are conducting defensive operations in the east, mostly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and are readying their own strategic reserves with the help of [Western] allies, both in terms of equipment and personnel.“The preparations mostly take place abroad because the equipment, for the most part, is foreign but not exclusively – because some equipment, APCs are Soviet-made, such as tanks, armoured vehicles that we can train to use much faster.“The principal question for us was the aviation component, a new step in the military aid. So far it hasn’t been solved politically but it may be cleared. I think more aid will be given [after US President Joe] Biden visits Poland.(Al Jazeera)“In 2022, the Ukrainian army was not the army of 2014 and 2015 [when it suffered heavy losses in Donbas]. We underwent a long way of transformation, of development according to NATO standards and according to the experience we gained in the warfare between 2014 and 2015.“If in the beginning of war, the potential of the enemy’s military grouping exceeded ours threefold, by now the difference is significantly less. But it’s still there.“The war’s outcome and victory should be about weakening Russia as an aggressive imperialist state, so that it won’t be able to conduct wars such as this for some time.”‘I am expecting the war to last long’Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, professor of Russian Politics at King’s College London:“Putin’s position is still stable despite the military setbacks and failure to reach the objectives articulated at the beginning of the invasion.[Gulnaz Sharafutdinova]“The different elite groupings seem to have consolidated behind Putin, with the military and other state security agencies increasing in influence and activity.“While many elites are likely critical of the war, the perceived imperative of Russia’s victory along with fear of retribution for disloyalty guides their actions and their strategy of sticking to Putin.“The lack of access to technology from sanctions undoubtedly cripples [Russian] military production capacity. While some components are sought out in non-Western countries, they cannot be replaced entirely.“In terms of the economy, even if Russian businesses and government have shown high adaptive capacity, such adaptability is not universal and some industrial sectors such as auto-making industry, for example, have dwindled by 60 percent or more. Sanctions do strain Russia’s economy, especially by squeezing the profits from the energy trade.“I am expecting the war to last long. However, I look forward to Ukraine’s counteroffensive and its results that might change Russia’s perceptions. Ukrainian forces have demonstrated earlier their capacity for recapturing their territories, so there is hope in that.”‘Russia’s war goals haven’t changed: destroying Ukraine’Pavel Luzin, a defence analyst with Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington, DC:“The main scenario is the same – an escalation. Russia made its first serious attempt at it in the fall and is making the second one now.The aim is to force [Kyiv] into giving [Moscow] a break under acceptable conditions so [Russia] can lick its wounds and wait for a better moment in a political sense for a new attack. Russia’s war goals haven’t changed – [they are about] destroying Ukraine.”‘One shouldn’t disregard Russia’s ability to recreate it all anew’Marat Gabidullin, an ex-Wagner fighter who penned a book describing his experiences in Syria:“Both sides lack the resources and capabilities to start a decisive offensive to break the situation in their favour.[Courtesy: Marat Gabidullin]“The [Russian] army is not ready for war. They made conclusions, corrected the situation, fixed some wrongs, but not significantly.“Even before [the war], I assumed that the Ukrainian army is capable of opposing an armed aggression. The Ukrainian army is not the way it was in 2014. They gained strength, gained experience, modernised.“They show resilience, their determination to keep on defending [Ukraine], to wage the war. They don’t succeed in everything, they have their drawbacks.“There is a danger that the war will morph into positional warfare but a lot depends on to what extent the West will supply the Ukrainian army with equipment and arms, and how the Ukrainian army can learn to use these arms and integrate them.“Modern weaponry takes a long time to master. If [the weapons] fit in the entire system of organising warfare, conducting it, then it is very likely that they can start a decisive counteroffensive and push Russian forces outside the [Ukrainian] state border.“The advantages of Western weaponry are obvious – no one doubts them. Ukraine still has human resources, they are capable of conducting an additional mobilisation, replenish their losses, form the necessary number of [military] units, train them properly.“But it’s hard to predict things because Russia is also not drawing its terminal breath. They also have certain reserves, resources, their military-industrial complex is working, all the potential is going towards supporting it, no other [branches of economy] are developing.“They keep producing rather modern weapons, maybe not the most perfect ones, but modern enough – equipment, tanks, APCs, ammo. One shouldn’t disregard Russia’s ability to recreate it all anew.”‘Based on what our sources say, a truce is impossible’Farida Rustamova, Russian journalist:“Putin’s position is as stable as it’s ever been. His security apparatus, which he uses to uphold his power in Russia, hasn’t changed a bit. He feeds them well, raises their wages and gives them all sorts of other perks. This can be seen with the record budget for security defence for the next few years. No serious opposition that could crack his hold on power can be seen at this moment in Russia.[Courtesy: Farida Rustamova]“The war had a great impact on Russian society. As indicated by sociological surveys, we can notice some trends. It’s obvious society was shaken, first when the war began and second when mobilisation was announced. Those were the two biggest earthquakes of the past year. This has only led to frustration, which didn’t manifest itself to mass protests because the repressive apparatus is too strong and those opposed to what’s happening have no way to show themselves.“I think that judging by how things are going, we’re definitely going to live through another year of war. The other day, [pro-Putin Chechen leader] Ramzan Kadyrov said the special operation will only end after a year or so. An interesting statement, I’m not sure what it’s founded on, but it’s curious.“But for now it’s obvious, based on what our sources say, a truce is impossible. Russia is still trying to advance, Ukraine doesn’t want to surrender. It doesn’t look as though things will calm down or take a pause.”‘There is no path to outright victory for either side’Almut Rochowanski, an activist who has worked in conflict and post-conflict regions in the former Soviet Union:“I expect that repressive measures and centralised propaganda will continue and probably be expanded more and more into all areas of public life, for example into the school system. I anticipate that all real and perceived ‘foreign influence’, especially on civil society, higher education, arts and culture, will be further curtailed. The economy will be put on a war footing, gradually, more than it has been to date. We may see new, more stringent policies on mobilisation and possibly preventing young men from travelling abroad.[Courtesy: Almut Rochowanski]“What space there was for new faces and ideas in policy-making and governance will shrink. This is a real loss, because contrary to widely-held stereotypes, Russia has had quite vibrant public debates about certain policy issues, creative experimentation with public services on the local and regional level, and no lack of talented policymakers.“I don’t see any growing enthusiasm among Russians for this war, only more quiet dejection, frustration, despair. No one is promising them a brighter, happier future now.“The hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who have fled the country, either because they were so appalled by the invasion of Ukraine or because they feared being mobilised to fight or both, are only a – somewhat privileged – tip of the iceberg. There are many more who feel similarly alienated and scared but are unable to leave.“For a much greater part of Russians, however, relatively little about their everyday lives has changed. The economic situation is bleak, but not more so than it was during the first year of the pandemic. The mood in the country is grim.“I realise that some circles harbour a fantasy of Putin being toppled through mass public protests, but we know that such revolts succeed only where there are significant alternative centre of power or well-organised movements, neither of which exist in Russia. And that’s assuming a critical mass of the populace would be up for public protests, which they are not – or that the well-oiled machinery of repression would not put a quick stop to it, which they are clearly able to do.“I don’t see this conflict ending anytime soon. There is no path to outright victory for either side. Neither is there recognition on either side that they want a political process, nor a conviction in the West that such a process would now be in their or Ukraine’s best interest, nor a consistent indication that Russia is prepared for meaningful negotiations.“Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that Ukraine and Russia are talking to each other, literally every day. There are Russian and Ukrainian military officers and diplomats coordinating the export of grain via the Black Sea, every day.

Democracy, dialogue and diplomacy is the way forward,” Anurag Thakur, India’s information minister, told a news conference on Wednesday after welcoming delegates to the meeting which ends on Saturday.Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from G20 nations will join the meeting on Friday.The meeting in the Nandi Hills summer retreat is the first major event of India’s G20 presidency and the war in Ukraine is likely to feature prominently during the proceedings. The first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of its neighbour falls on Friday.India has kept a neutral stance on the war, declining to blame Russia for the invasion, seeking a diplomatic solution and increasing its purchases of Russian oil over the past year.Russia has been India’s biggest supplier of military equipment for decades and it is the fourth-biggest market for the South Asian country’s pharmaceutical products.“Many nations are keen on their turn to speak on the Russia-Ukraine war,” said a central bank deputy governor from one of the attending countries, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Russia themselves want to discuss the economic impact of sanctions.”The Russian embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs are also expected to discuss unblocking debt restructuring for distressed economies that have been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.Reuters news agency reported last week that India has drafted a proposal for G20 countries to help debtor nations by asking lenders, including the world’s largest sovereign creditor China, to take a large haircut on loans.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and German Finance Minister Christian Lindner will be attending the meetings and are expected to press China to “quickly deliver” on debt relief for low and middle-income countries.During the event, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plans to hold a meeting with the World Bank, India, China, Saudi Arabia, the United States and other Group of Seven (G7) nations to try to reach an understanding on common standards, principles and definitions on how to restructure distressed country debt.Rules on cryptocurrencies, reform of multilateral development banks, international taxation and securing adequate finance to combat climate change are also on the agenda of the meetings, which chiefs of the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank will also attend.However, neither the Russian finance minister nor the central bank chief was expected to attend the meeting. They will be represented by their deputies.The G20 includes the world’s largest economies and has a rolling presidency.

The visit is reportedly part of Chinese efforts to push for multi-party peace talks.Russian officials on Wednesday blamed the United States and the West for President Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend Moscow’s participation in the New START treaty, as Russia’s parliament was set to rubber-stamp the move.Russia has called a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the bombings in September of the Nord Stream pipelines after calling for a UN investigation into the incident.Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya has raised concern over Western countries’ lack of will to cooperate with Moscow to shed light on the pipeline’s blast, the TASS news agency has reported.Russia’s economy contracted by 2.1 percent last year, the federal statistics service said on Monday, shrinking less than expected despite its invasion of Ukraine last February and sanctions imposed by European nations and the United States.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has made her first visit to Ukraine where she said Italy “would not waver” in its support for Ukraine after controversial remarks from a coalition partner who blamed Zelenskyy for the war.FightingIn the past 24 hours, Russia launched 59 attacks from heavy rocket systems, Ukraine’s military has said.Bakhmut city, the focus of Russian advances in the eastern region of Donetsk, came under shelling, along with 20 other settlements in the area, it said.A rift between Russia’s military and the Wagner private contractor company is widening as the group’s chief Yevgeny Prigozhin accused Russian officials of high treason after alleging they held back much-needed ammunition.The Russian defence ministry rejected his accusation about blocking ammunition as “absolutely untrue”.",0.08243,0.31942,3027,6,3,16,3,2

China will also use the summit to reiterate calls that nuclear weapons should not be used, the report added.Preparations for the trip are at an early stage and the timing has not been finalised, the Journal said, adding that Xi’s visit might take place in April or in early May when Russia celebrates its World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.China’s top diplomat Wang Yi is currently in Moscow and expected to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday.In a tour of Europe, Wang has stepped up calls for a negotiated settlement to end the war in Ukraine, which began on February 24 last year when Russian troops invaded the country.Xi and Putin last met in person in China ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics last year, days before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The two men announced a “no limits” partnership where no areas of cooperation were “forbidden”. They had a video call last December.Beijing has not condemned Russia’s actions or joined Western-led sanctions against Moscow but it has urged “restraint” and stressed disputes should be settled by “peaceful means”.Meanwhile, its relations with the United States have deteriorated over issues such as human rights in Hong Kong and China’s far western region of Xinjiang, as well as the US discovery this month of what it has claimed was a Chinese “spy balloon” flying over its territory.In Moscow on Tuesday, Wang again stressed the two countries’ close ties in a meeting with Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s powerful Security Council and a close confidant of Putin.“Chinese-Russian relations are mature in character: they are rock solid and will withstand any test in a changing international situation,” Wang told Patrushev through a Russian interpreter in remarks aired on Russian state television.Patrushev, meanwhile, told Wang that Beijing was a top priority in Russian foreign policy and that the two countries must stick together.“In the context of a campaign that is being waged by the collective West to contain both Russia and China, the further deepening of Russian-Chinese cooperation and interaction in the international arena is of particular importance,” Patrushev was quoted as saying by state media outlet RIA.Wang is expected to discuss Xi’s trip while he is in Moscow, the Wall Street Journal said.The Kremlin has hinted Wang might also meet Putin.",0.06601,0.25658,2767,2,3,13,5,0
39,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/wagner-mercenary-chief-accuses-russian-army-officials-of-treason,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, owner of the mercenary company Wagner, has accused Russia’s top military leaders of high treason after alleging they held back much-needed ammunition for the fight in Ukraine and declined to provide air support.Prigozhin’s Wagner Group is spearheading the battle for the town of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.“There is simply direct opposition going on [to attempts to equip Wagner fighters]. This can be equated to high treason,” Prigozhin said in a voice message posted on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.“The chief of the general staff and the defence minister are giving orders right and left, not just not to give Wagner PMC [private military company] ammunition but not to help it with air transport.”Prigozhin has been one of defence minister Sergey Shoigu’s most fiery critics, insisting his own men are far more effective than the regular army. Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov was appointed last month to run the war in Ukraine.His voice rising to a shout, Prigozhin accused the military brass of deciding “people should die when it’s convenient for them”, and said Wagner fighters were “dropping like flies” in the absence of necessary supplies.Senior officials also declined Wagner’s requests for special spades to dig trenches, he added.Public outburstsPrigozhin, a catering tycoon who used his wealth to build a private army, has assumed a more public role since the start of the war in Ukraine a year ago.He has revelled in being sanctioned by the West, publicly insulted Russia’s top military commanders, tried to parlay battlefield success into political influence, and detailed his recruitment of convicts for Wagner’s ranks.Prigozhin has also forged an informal alliance with fellow hardliners including the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, and accused the defence ministry of trying to take credit for Wagner’s successes in eastern Ukraine.But his star appears to be waning. He was stripped this year of the right to recruit prisoners amid signs of a Kremlin move to curb his influence.Russias defence ministry denied limiting ammunition shipments to volunteers at the front but made no mention of the Wagner force.“Attempts to create a split within the close mechanism of interaction and support between units of the Russian [fighting] groups are counterproductive and work solely to the benefit of the enemy,” the ministry said in a statement later on Tuesday.Alexey Muraviev, a Russia expert at Curtin University in Australia, told Al Jazeera that Prigozhin is seeking to secure military contracts from the Russian government.“Clearly, it [criticism] is happening at a time when the Kremlin is readjusting its strategy in Ukraine, and Prigozhin wants a major slice of this cake. Effectively, he wants to monopolise Russia’s operations in Ukraine by saying, ‘I want it all. Give me what I need.'”‘Get rid of nonsense’It was the second such message directed at defence officials published by Prigozhin in two days.In an obscenity-peppered message on Monday, he complained unnamed officials were denying Wagner supplies out of personal animosity to him, and he was required to “apologise and obey” in order to rectify the situation.The defence ministry has previously said Wagner is not under its control even though the militia depends on the state for some arms and logistics.Tatiana Stanovaya, head of the R.Politik political consultancy, said Prigozhin’s outburst on Monday looked like “an act of desperation” aimed at “getting through to Putin”.It was not clear whether he had Prigozhin in mind but Putin in a speech on Tuesday said he wanted an end to infighting.“We must get rid of – I want to emphasise this – any interdepartmental contradictions, formalities, grudges, misunderstandings, and other nonsense,” Putin told the political and military elite.In a separate post, Prigozhin said later on Tuesday he had been too busy to watch Putin’s speech and could therefore not comment on the president’s remarks regarding Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.",0.10551,0.31017,4047,8,2,9,4,0
40,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/russia-calls-un-meeting-on-nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage,"Russia called a Security Council meeting over the bombing of the Nord Stream pipelines after circulating a resolution calling for an urgent UN investigation.In advance of the meeting on Tuesday, the ambassadors of Denmark, Sweden and Germany sent a letter to council members saying their investigations have established the pipelines were extensively damaged “by powerful explosions due to sabotage”.The letter said further investigations are being conducted in all three countries and it is unclear when they will finish. Russian authorities have been informed about the continuing investigations.Security Council experts held closed consultations on Monday on the Russian draft resolution and council diplomats said there was opposition to it. No vote was expected at Tuesday’s meeting, council diplomats said.Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.The explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines took place on September 26.Russia has alleged the US was behind the attack, and the country’s resolution said the sabotage “occurred after the repeated threats to the Nord Stream by the leadership of the United States”.The US has denied the allegation. US Department of State spokesman Ned Price last week called it “pure disinformation” that the US was involved in targeting Nord Stream.‘Substantial and worrisome’In their letter to the council, Denmark, Sweden and Germany reiterated that acts of sabotage against the pipelines were “unacceptable, endanger international security and give cause for our deep concern”.Concerns about the indirect effects on greenhouse gas emissions are “substantial and worrisome”, the letter said.The Russian draft resolution expressed serious concern at the “devastating consequences to the environment” from the acts of sabotage, which also “pose a threat to international peace and security”.The attack is estimated to have released 778 million cubic metres of methane – the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, raising new fears of the effect on the climate emergency.In Germany, the federal prosecutor has launched a criminal investigation to establish if a crime of sabotage under section 88 of the criminal code was committed.The Russian draft asked UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to urgently establish an independent international investigation of the sabotage to identify “its perpetrators, sponsors, organisers and accomplices”.Pipeline operator Russia and other interested parties have been barred from national investigations into the matter, it said.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.05428,0.31171,3451,1,0,9,0,0

Russian officials have said that sending arms to Ukraine prolongs and intensifies the conflict.On Tuesday, Biden stressed that Putin is failing in the Ukraine conflict and its strategic aims.“He thought he’d get the Finland-isation of NATO; instead he got the NATO-isation of Finland and Sweden,” Biden said, referring to the two northern European countries’ push to join the US-led alliance.Biden also reaffirmed the US commitment to the “sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory”. The alliance has a mutual defence pact, meaning an attack on any of its members is considered an attack on all.The US president accused Russian forces of committing “crimes against humanity without shame or compunction” in Ukraine – a determination formally made by Washington last week.“No one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It’s abhorrent,” Biden said.Crimes against humanity are systemic or widespread abuses – including murder, mass deportations or apartheid – directed against a civilian population.Russia has rejected the US accusation as an attempt to “demonise” Moscow and inflame the conflict in Ukraine.Addressing the crowd ahead of Biden on Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda lauded the US president’s visit to Kyiv as a “spectacular gesture” of support to Ukraine.“He put his foot on Ukrainian soil where war is raging. He demonstrated that the free world and its leaders are not afraid of anything,” Duda said of Biden.“He showed that Ukraine is not alone, that it is supported by the most powerful state in the world and by the most powerful armed forces in the world.”Duda expressed confidence that Kyiv will “win” the war, and that “Russia will have to leave Ukrainian land with shame”.",0.12135,0.3237,3870,17,7,14,5,0
42,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/shifting-the-blame-ukraine-responds-to-putins-address,"Kyiv, Ukraine – To many in the West, the most frightening part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s national address on Tuesday was the suspension of Moscow’s participation in a key nuclear arms treaty.The only pact that regulates the world’s largest nuclear arsenals in the United States and Russia, the New START Treaty limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles Moscow and Washington can have.But for Ukrainian observers, the threat of a new Cold War was nothing but a bluff aimed at disguising Putin’s desperation following Russia’s military failures, international ostracism, and economic sanctions imposed by the West.And it was easier for him to blame what he calls “the collective West” for these failures, because admitting Ukraine withstood the aggression, fought back, and regained lost areas is too painful and humiliating, Ukrainian pundits say.The “we-will-take-Kyiv-in-three-days” blitzkrieg that Putin initially planned turned into a quagmire that showed how disorganised and weak the Russian military really is.“We will achieve the [military] goals we set step by step, accurately and consecutively,” Putin said at the beginning of the address.The main message of Putin’s speech was to shift the blame from his own role in unleashing the war to accusing the West of “starting” the conflict by backing the “neo-Nazi junta” in Kyiv, analysts said.“The essence of the entire address is in the transition from ‘I made a decision to start a special military operation’ to ‘It’s them who started the war,’” said Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists in Kyiv.“The rest is a noisy cover,” she told Al Jazeera.‘Played with people’s lives’Putin used colourful epithets from a gambler’s lexicon to describe how the West plotted against Russia the way it planned to “destroy” Iraq, Syria and Libya.“When Russia sincerely – I want to emphasise it – sincerely strove for a peaceful solution [in Ukraine], they played with people’s lives, played, as they say in notorious circles, with marked cards,” he said.Shifting the blame also meant that Putin wanted Russians to get ready for a long war, tighten their belts, and blame the entire Western world for every discomfort, another Ukrainian pundit said.“Russia doesn’t believe in the possibility of a quick victory,” Igar Tyshkevych, a Kyiv-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera.The Kremlin understands any truce inked directly between Moscow and Kyiv bears risks – and wants Western involvement.“The threats of nuclear proliferation, the threats to widen the conflict are nothing but a hysterical invitation of Western leaders to discuss Russia’s place in the future,” Tyshkevych told Al Jazeera.However, such a discussion is hardly possible in the nearest future, so the Kremlin has placed its bets on the presumed success of a new military offensive in Ukraine, which may start in the spring or early summer (Winter ends in Europe in late March).Putin’s entire speech is but an attempt to talk about little details without understanding the whole, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch said.Putin talked “about the war without mentioning the war’s goals, about [Russia’s] subjective sovereignty without understanding how the model will work”, he said.‘Cruelty and aggression’Putin has for years used the term “sovereign democracy” to describe the difference between Russian and Western models of governing the state and justify the tightening of political screws during his 23 years-long rule.However, during his speech, he bristled at the West for starting an “economic war” against Moscow through crippling sanctions.Putin declared “an urge to have a sovereign model and at the same time — [expressed his] offence by the sanctions”, Kushch said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not comment on Putin’s speech, but lambasted Russia for Tuesday’s shelling of the southern city of Kherson that killed at least six and wounded dozens.“The world doesn’t have the right to forget even for a minute that Russia’s cruelty and aggression know no border. The terrorist-state will be held responsible for all of its inhuman crimes against our people and Ukraine,” Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.His adviser derided Putin’s “confusion” and belief that Ukraine is ruled by “neo-Nazis.”“Putin publicly showed his backwardness and confusion and emphasised that Russia is in an undoubtful backwoods end-of-the-road,” Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.“And that he doesn’t and won’t have perspective decisions. Because everywhere [around him] are Nazis and conspiracy theories,” Podolyak wrote.‘Liberate us from ourselves?’Even Putin’s former loyalists fighting in Ukraine lambasted him for failing to address the actual losses the Russian army had suffered – and the responsibility of top brass and civilian leaders for the death toll and miscalculations.“In the army, everything is beautiful and is only getting better. Not a word about losses, bad luck, difficulties,” Igor Girkin, a former “defence minister” of the separatist “People’s Republic of Donetsk” wrote on Telegram.“Not a word about mistakes and the responsibility for them of someone from the halls of power,” Girkin, who has been showering Putin and Russia’s generals with criticism from the front lines for months, wrote.Meanwhile, Ukrainians generally choose not to pay attention to what Putin said.“What new can I hear from him? That our Jewish president is a Nazi? That I am a Nazi? That they want to liberate us from ourselves?” said Yelena Kalynichenko, a sales clerk in Kyiv.“He is obsessed with Ukraine, with putting an end to our very existence. But it will be us who will put an end to his rule,” the 35-year-old mother of two, whose brother is serving in the military, told Al Jazeera.",0.0324,0.35874,5760,8,8,16,17,2
43,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/plane-motorcade-train-how-joe-biden-got-to-kyiv-in-secret,"President Joe Biden’s surprise visit Monday morning to wartime Kyiv began in the dead of night at a military airport hangar outside Washington, DC.At 4:00 am (09:00 GMT) Sunday, unbeknown to the world’s media, the Washington political establishment or American voters, the 80-year-old Democrat boarded an Air Force Boeing 757, known as a C-32.The plane, a smaller version of the one US presidents normally use on international trips, was parked well away from where Biden would usually board. And a telling detail: The shade on every window had been pulled down.The White House had discussed the possibility of a Biden trip to Kyiv for a year, and the president made the final decision to go on Friday. The trip was the first for a US president into an active warzone where US forces were not involved in the fighting and the US did not control the airspace.Fifteen minutes after arriving at Joint Base Andrews early Sunday morning, Biden, a handful of security personnel, a small medical team, close advisers, and two journalists who had been sworn to secrecy, took off en route to a warzone.The US president is perhaps the most constantly scrutinised person on the planet.Members of the press follow Biden wherever he goes, whether to church or international summits. Every word he says in public is recorded, transcribed and published.In this case, though, the usual pool of reporters, which for foreign trips would consist of 13 journalists from radio, TV, photo and written press organisations, was cut to one photographer and one writer.The reporter, Sabrina Siddiqui from The Wall Street Journal, revealed, once allowed by the White House to publish details, that she and the photographer were summoned to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington at 2:15am (07:15 GMT).Their phones were confiscated, not to be returned until Biden finally arrived in the Ukrainian capital about 24 hours later.They flew for about seven hours from Washington to the US military base in Ramstein, Germany, for refuelling. Here, too, the window shades stayed down and they did not leave the plane.The next flight was to Poland, landing in Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport. This may be a Polish airport, but since the Ukraine war, it has also become an international hub for the US-led effort to arm the Ukrainians, funnelling billions of dollars of weaponry and ammunition.Up to this point, Siddiqui and the photographer, The Associated Press’s Evan Vucci, had not seen Biden himself. That did not change at the airport or when they got into a motorcade of SUVs.Reporters travelling with Biden often go in motorcades, but something was very different about this one: No sirens or anything else to announce that the US president was headed to Przemysl Glowny, the Polish train station near the Ukrainian border.It was already 9:15pm local time (20:15 GMT) as they pulled up at a train. The journalists were told to board, still without laying eyes on Biden.Running a route that has brought untold quantities of aid into Ukraine and untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians fleeing the other way, the train had about eight cars. Most of the people on board, Siddiqui said, were “heavy security”.Biden is an avowed train buff.President Joe Biden arrives for a surprise visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Monday, February 20, 2023, in Kyiv. [Evan Vucci/Pool/AP]He loves recounting his years of commuting by rail riding the US train carrier Amtrak between Washington and home in Delaware when he was a senator, bringing up two young sons after their mother died in a car accident. One of his nicknames is “Amtrak Joe”.This 10-hour trip into Ukraine, though, was unlike any taken by a modern US president, journeying into an active warzone where, unlike presidential visits to Afghanistan or Iraq, US troops are not the ones providing security.The train rolled into Kyiv with the rising sun.Biden, who had last visited the Ukrainian capital when he was vice president under Barack Obama disembarked at about 8:07am (06:07 GMT) Monday.The area around the platform had been cleared and the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, awaited Biden and his staff.“It’s good to be back in Kyiv,” he said.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who accompanied the president, said US officials did notify Russian officials that Biden would be travelling to Kyiv. “We did so some hours before his departure for deconfliction purposes,” he told reporters on a conference call, declining to provide more details.The head of Russia’s Special Security Service (FSB) confirmed Sullivan’s account.“The United States did notify Russia about Biden’s visit to Kyiv through a diplomatic channel. We did not give guarantees of his safety,” FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov was quoted by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency as saying Tuesday.Sullivan said the trip had “required a security, operational, and logistical effort from professionals across the US government to take what was an inherently risky undertaking and make it a manageable level of risk”.",-0.01177,0.35396,5028,4,6,4,0,1
44,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/russias-leader-putin-accuses-west-for-war-in-major-speech,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a combative state-of-the-nation speech, blaming the West for the war in Ukraine ahead of the first anniversary of the invasion he ordered.Putin spoke on Tuesday in front of a crowd of 1,400 people in Moscow, addressing members of both houses of parliament, military commanders and soldiers while video screens were also put up in large cities across the country.Besides warning the West of a global confrontation, Putin sought to justify the invasion, saying it had been forced on Russia and he understood the pain of the families of those who had fallen in battle.He also said Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, the last major pillar of post-Cold War nuclear arms control between Moscow and Washington, which limits their strategic nuclear arsenals.Putin said Russia needed to be ready to test nuclear weapons if the United States moves to do so itself.Almost immediately, global powers urged Moscow against withdrawing from the treaty.“The announcement by Russia that it’s suspending participation is deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does. We’ll of course make sure that in any event, we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.”The New START treaty, which was signed in Prague in 2010, caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads Russia and the US may deploy, It also caps the number of deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver the warheads.Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, with close to 6,000 warheads, according to experts. Together, Russia and the US hold about 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads – enough to destroy the planet many times over.In 2021, New START was extended for five more years after US President Joe Biden took office.Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from Brussels, says arms negotiation has been more difficult in recent years due to tensions between Moscow and the West.“NATO allies say that Russia wasn’t really complying with New START anyway,” he said. “But it is interesting that Putin has decided to suspend participation in this treaty, … and I think probably that’s for international consumption at this stage.“I think there was an element of this speech that was aimed at the international community because although Europe seems to be very much on the same page with the US in terms of support for Ukraine, beyond Europe … when it comes to the issue of when should the war stop and when should there be negotiations, many believe a ceasefire should come soon, if not now.“That is the difference that Putin was potentially trying to exploit in his speech.” In his wide-ranging and angry speech, Putin also condemned same-sex marriage and cast the government in Kyiv as taking the Ukrainian people “hostage” for failing to address their needs.“I would like to repeat, they started the war, and we used force in order to stop it,” Putin said, insisting Moscow had tried to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which had been simmering since early 2014, by peaceful means but was eventually forced to take further action.“We were doing everything possible to solve this problem peacefully, negotiating a peaceful way out of this difficult conflict, but behind our backs, a very different scenario was being prepared,” the Russian leader said.The West and aspiring NATO and European Union member Ukraine strongly reject that narrative and say NATO’s expansion eastwards after the Cold War is no justification for what they say is an imperial-style land grab doomed to failure.“The people of Ukraine have become the hostage of the Kyiv regime and its Western overlords, who have effectively occupied this country in the political, military and economic sense,” Putin said.“They intend to transform a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation. This is exactly how we understand it all, and we will react accordingly because in this case, we are talking about the existence of our country.”Putin claims Russia is locked in an existential battle with the West, which, he says, wants to carve up Russia and steal its vast natural resources.“The Western elite does not conceal their goal, which is to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia,” the president said. “It means to finish us forever.”The 70-year-old Kremlin chief said Russia would never yield to Western attempts to divide its society, adding that a majority of Russians support the war.Polling by the Levada Centre indicates abound 75 percent of Russians back Russian actions in Ukraine while 19 percent do not and 6 percent do not know. Three-quarters of Russians expect their country to be victorious.But many diplomats and analysts doubt the figures.Marwan Kabalan, an academic and writer, told Al Jazeera Putin’s speech was aimed at appeasing Russians because Moscow has not achieved its military goals in Ukraine.“He underestimated the power of Ukraine’s military” and Western support, as well as the “will of Europeans” to free themselves of Russian energy supplies, Kabalan said.“He cannot tell the people of Russia any good news about this,” he said. “This special operation as he calls it has been going on now for almost a year and the objectives have not been achieved.”(Al Jazeera)Russian forces have suffered three significant battlefield reversals since the war began but still control abound one-fifth of Ukraine.Meanwhile, a rivalry within parts of Russia’s military elite seems to be increasing, with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the private mercenary force the Wagner Group criticising Russian military officials of depriving his fighters of munitions.Reactions to Putin’s speechA leading official in the US denounced the claims in Putin’s speech.“Nobody is attacking Russia,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. “There’s a kind of absurdity in the notion that Russia was under some form of military threat from Ukraine or anyone else.”Mykhailo Podolyak, the senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, said Putin’s speech demonstrated his “irrelevance and confusion”.“He stressed that RF [the Russian Federation] is in ‘taiga deadlock’, has no promising solutions and won’t have any. Because everywhere there are ‘Nazis, Martians and conspiracy theories’,” Podolyak tweeted.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the speech “propaganda” and said she had hoped for something more constructive.“A part of my heart hoped for some different words, for a step ahead. It was propaganda,” Meloni said during a visit to the Ukrainian city of Irpin.",0.07314,0.36956,6702,11,13,28,14,0

It came into force the following year and was extended in 2021 for five more years after United States President Joe Biden took office.It caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, with close to 6,000 warheads, according to experts. Together, Russia and the United States hold about 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads – enough to destroy the planet many times over.‘A watershed moment for our country’“I am making this address at a time which we all know is a difficult, watershed moment for our country, a time of cardinal, irreversible changes around the world, the most important historic events that will shape the future of our country and our people, when each of us bears a colossal responsibility.”Western nations trying to ‘distract people’s attention’“They just tried to use these principles of democracy and freedom to defend their totalitarian values and they tried to distract people’s attention from corruption scandals … from economic-social problems.”‘Responsibility is on West and Ukrainian elite’“The responsibility is on the West and the Ukrainian elite and government, which does not serve the national interest, but [rather serves the interest] of third countries [which] use Ukraine as a military base to fight Russia.“The more they send weapons to Ukraine, the more we will have the responsibility of the security situation at the Russian border. This is a natural response.”‘We don’t fight the Ukrainian people’“We don’t fight with the Ukrainian people. They became hostages of the Kyiv regime that occupied Ukraine both economically and politically. Over years, they were doing everything to bring this degradation … They are using their people, it’s sad but true.”Donbas subjected to ‘undisguised hatred’“Step by step, carefully and consistently, we will resolve the tasks facing us. Since 2014, the (people of the) Donbas had been fighting, defending their right to live on their own land, to speak their native language.“They fought and did not give up in the conditions of blockade and constant shelling, undisguised hatred on the part of the Kyiv regime. They believed and expected that Russia would come to their rescue.“Meanwhile, we did our best to solve this problem by peaceful means. We patiently tried to negotiate a peaceful way out of this most difficult conflict, but a completely different scenario was being prepared behind our backs.”‘Reviving enterprises and jobs’ in occupied Ukrainian lands“We have already begun and will continue to build up a large-scale programme for the socioeconomic recovery and development of these new subjects of the federation (territory annexed from Ukraine). We are talking about reviving enterprises and jobs in the ports of the Sea of Azov, which has again become an inland sea of Russia, and building new modern roads, as we did in Crimea.”‘I understand how unbearably hard it is’ for families of killed soldiersPutin said he understood how difficult it was for relatives of Russian soldiers who had died fighting in Ukraine, and promised “targeted support” with a new special fund.“We all understand, I understand how unbearably hard it is now for the wives, sons, daughters of fallen soldiers, their parents, who raised worthy defenders of the Fatherland.”‘Child abuse all the way up to paedophilia … advertised as the norm’ in the West“They distort historical facts and constantly attack our culture, the Russian Orthodox Church, and other traditional religions of our country,” Putin said of Western nations supporting Ukraine.“As it became known, the Anglican Church plans to consider the idea of a gender-neutral God … Millions of people in the West understand they are being led to a real spiritual catastrophe.“Look at what they do to their own people: the destruction of families, of cultural and national identities and the perversion that is child abuse all the way up to paedophilia, are advertised as the norm … and priests are forced to bless same-sex marriages.”",0.06517,0.44046,4689,7,3,13,3,0

In 2021, the economy saw a 5.6 percent year-on-year rise.The economy ministry had at one point predicted a contraction of more than 12 percent last year, exceeding the falls in output seen after the Soviet Union collapsed and during the 1998 financial crisis.In April 2022, the World Bank predicted a contraction of 11.2 percent.“Due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia faces the largest coordinated economic sanctions ever imposed on a country,” the World Bank said in a statement.“Russia’s economy will be hit very hard, with a deep recession looming in 2022. GDP is expected to contract by 11.2 percent, with little recovery in the ensuing two years,” it added.Before the conflict in Ukraine began, the Russian government had expected GDP growth of 3 percent in 2022.Manufacturing industries and wholesale and retail trade were among the sectors that declined in 2022, while agriculture, hospitality, construction and mining all registered growth.Public administration and “military security” gained 4.1 percent in 2022, the statistics agency said, adding to a 3.3 percent rise in 2021. President Vladimir Putin in January paid tribute to the defence sector for supporting the economy.Increased military spending is smoothing out a drop in the country’s industrial production, analysts say.Net exports increased to 12.8 percent from 9.3 percent, “due to the prices of exported fuel and energy products being significantly above imports”.Russia’s current account surplus hit a record high in 2022, as a fall in imports and robust oil and gas exports kept foreign money flowing in, despite Western efforts to isolate the Russian economy over the conflict in Ukraine with successive rounds of sanctions.In January, the surplus shrank 58.2 percent year-on-year to $8bn, squeezing Russia’s capital buffers at a time when Moscow is ramping up budget spending.The country’s central bank on Monday estimated the 2022 economic contraction at 2.5 percent.Forecasts for 2023 are varied. The government expects a decline of 0.8 percent, while the International Monetary Fund believes the economy could grow by 0.3 percent as commodity exports have proved resilient.",0.00157,0.23088,2532,4,0,7,1,0
47,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/qa-dr-pavel-felgenhauer-russia-ukraine-war,"Moscow, Russia – As the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine approaches on Friday, Al Jazeera spoke to Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian defence analyst who served as a senior research officer in the Soviet Academy of Sciences.Felgenhauer, who has published widely on Russian foreign and defence policies, military doctrine, arms trade and the military-industrial complex, believes the war is likely to escalate but could end this year.According to him, after 12 months of bloody battles, “the intensity of the fighting is too high for it to be maintained for long”.Which side will ultimately seize a decisive victory?Like most experts, he says it is simply unpredictable.Independent military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer [File: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP]Al Jazeera: Why do you think an escalation is imminent? Pavel Felgenhauer: We cannot totally predict everything. But I believe that an escalation right now is imminent. An escalation in the fighting; everyone is talking about a Russian offensive. Western military commanders in Brussels are also talking about how the Ukrainians should go on the offensive. General Mark Milley [Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff], who a year ago was talking about how Kyiv could fall in couple of days, now says that Russia has lost strategically, operationally and tactically, and Ukraine should sort of go out to finish them off.Ukraine is preparing something, but again of course, everyone is following the teachings of Sun Tzu, meaning war is deceit. And if you want to attack, you pretend that you don’t, if you’re ready to attack and strong enough, you pretend that you’re not ready and you’re not strong at all. And vice versa — if you’re not strong, you pretend that you are strong. So there’s lots of disinformation right now circling around. Each side is seeking surprise.Al Jazeera: But there have already been surprises on the battlefields?Felgenhauer: Ukrainians did it in September in Kharkiv. They achieved surprise and achieved a lot. Not only did they capture some important strategic points and force the Russians to withdraw from Kherson to get the reserves — they also forced the Russians to begin the mobilisation programme that caused a lot of economical and political problems.I mean, they withdrew several hundred thousand men from the economy into the military, and almost up to two million fled the country at the same time — which is a big drag on the economy too.Al Jazeera: Isn’t Russia faring better than expected? Doesn’t the economy seem to be stable even after strict sanctions? Felgenhauer: Russia, of course right now, has very serious financial problems with a deficit that’s being financed by printing money. It has problems on the battlefield at the same time.I don’t see how this can continue in the present pattern for a long time. It’s like football, you never know what’s going to happen actually on the battlefield. There’s a well-known saying that “Russia is never a strong as your fear”, as we see during this year, but “Russia is also never as weak as you hope”. So you can’t just write off Russia. The intensity of the fighting is too high for it to be maintained for long.There will be problems in the West with supply, but they are a bit more manageable because the Rammstein collation’s gross GDP is more than 100 times of Russia. So financially and economically, they are more prepared for a longer conflict than the Russians.But who’s going to win? I don’t know, war is like football. Everyone who believes that Brazil should win but it doesn’t win every time.Al Jazeera: If it is such a drag, why did Russian President Vladimir Putin go to war?Felgenhauer: There was a military reason — to prevent Western missiles appearing in Ukraine for a direct strike on Moscow.There was a geopolitical reason — to reunite the Russian people, assuming that Ukrainians are Russian people, and to defy the West and actually undermine Western unity.Also, to cause friction within the Western alliance and also establish a new multipolar world.So there were a lot of different reasons, including the belief that the Russian military is so strong that this is going to be a very swift and very effective military victory that will bring a lot of different political, economic and geopolitical dividends. That this is the right thing in the right time.Al Jazeera: So what went wrong for Russia? Felgenhauer: The Russian military turned out to be not as strong as not only the West believes, but its own leadership believes. It’s not ready for modern warfare.The Ukrainians are much better, they were better prepared organisationally and in terms of command and control, in terms of command personnel, and then they got better weapons than the Russians.The Russian military has been isolated for more than 100 years from world tendencies in war-making. They are still living in the world of tanks, believing that if you mass enough, victory falls into your lap.Elizaveta, 94, is transported by a cargo cart to the evacuation train in Kherson, Ukraine, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022 [Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]They were not prepared intellectually, mentally, and physically for the conflict.There were, of course, people even in the Russian military saying that this is a bad idea, that there’s going to be lots of Ukrainian resistance, that Ukraine has a lot of troops — and there’s going to be Western support.But those who were making the top political decisions apparently lived in the dream world.Al Jazeera: But tensions between Ukraine, an ex-Soviet state keen to be absorbed into the Western political landscape, and Russia did not begin suddenly on February 24, 2022. There’s a historical context to all this, isn’t there? Felgenhauer: Of course, this conflict has a long history after the demise of the Soviet Union and the breakup between Ukraine and Russia. This was a serious trauma for the Russian elite. They believed that this was wrong and Ukraine was seen as an integral part of Russia. So, in the end, we will all get back together, back again happily into one great big old Russian family. That’s what many officials told me in the 1990s — that there were no problems that, for instance, there are negative birth rates in Russia and the number of Russians is declining. They said, ‘No problem, Pavel, we will take over a half of Ukraine or Belarus, a half of Kazakhstan, will get after 40 million good Slavic people into the fold and everything is going to be just OK’.The idea that Ukraine has left Russia for good and will become a totally independent entity was not really contemplated. Maybe as a temporary thing, but not for keeps.Al Jazeera: Where does Putin stand on this?Felgenhauer: Putin has been saying effectively that a semi-independent Ukraine is tolerable, as long as it had a kind of political integration with Russia.But for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union, a member of NATO, that is totally unacceptable. [Russia] believe many Ukrainians and Russian speakers may not want that. [Until recently] Ukrainian joining NATO was not a majority opinion in Ukraine. So this was a kind of moving factor that [Russia believed it] should prevent — the integration of Ukraine in European and Atlantic structures, especially NATO.Al Jazeera: Is it just sociopolitical? An opposition to the integration of Russian speakers with Europe…Felgenhauer: There are specific military reasons.The Russian military, since the time of the Cold War, believed the West is preparing so-called decapitating attacks. [So the theory goes], any kind of war between Russia and NATO, or Russia and the United States, begins with a decapitating attack to physically destroy and to disable the Russian military and political leadership. Their plans are to decapitate Russia and then finish all the disorganised resistance.The West has been building capabilities for such a strike. This led to the missile crisis in Europe of the 1980s, when the Americans deployed ballistic missiles which were accurate. These were missiles with guided warheads that could reach Moscow region in several minutes from Germany and also cruise missiles that were smaller but also were very accurate. This crisis almost led to war and then disarmament with the end of the Cold War. But the Russian military never forgot it.Al Jazeera: So what has the military been telling its commander-in-chief?Felgenhauer: From the time of the Soviet political bureau, it’s been essentially telling the political elite, “These guys want to kill you. Personally, you, members of the Kremlin, the ruling political bureau”.Then they were telling the same to President Vladimir Putin, that there is a decapitating attack being prepared. This is very serious.Al Jazeera: Why hasn’t diplomacy worked?Felgenhauer: In the West, some say the conflict can be frozen on present conditions, others want to continue to defeat Russia on the battlefield. There’s no unity in their ranks.There’s not real incentive for Russia either, for President Putin to surrender Kherson, Mariupol, Crimea, even the Donbas — it looks like political suicide.Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, on Sunday, November 20, 2022 [File: LIBKOS/AP]The Minsk agreements, in September 2014, were signed because of a Russian initiative. There was no Western mediation with Minsk I because the thinking was that [then-president Petro] Poroshenko will have enough power to make deals with Russia. He will be our man. Then there was Minsk II, that came about with European moderation.What Russia wanted was a guarantee that it will have a foothold in Ukraine. It turned out that it doesn’t work and Ukraine is moving in the “wrong direction”. The Russian military was ready to go before; actually in 2014 [Russian defence minister Sergei] Shoigu announced that we are going over the border in April. Then several times, they prepared. The last big dry run was in April 2021, when Russia gathered a massive force on the Ukrainian borders but then didn’t go in.Al Jazeera: Surely there is a tremendous human and economic cost for this war of attrition?Felgenhauer: There are really heavy losses on both sides. We are talking about tremendous loss of life. Apparently, these losses are not prohibitive and both Russians and Ukrainians are ready to continue. So both sides right now, both people are ready to continue the fight. But I don’t think that this will last indefinitely.Al Jazeera: Do you believe that this conflict will come to its end soon?Felgenhauer: I believe it will end this year.They tried talks in March, then meetings in Istanbul, which hinted that they’re moving towards some kind of an agreement. But Russia and Ukraine were miles apart.Ukraine was more or less ready to agree in February 2022. Now Ukrainians say they want more and Russia also says it wants more. So again, two sides are miles apart.It seems that there’s no political agreement or even a tentative ceasefire in the offing.Of course, Russia right now wants to freeze the situation more or less as it is on the line of control, as it is. Ukraine says it doesn’t want that. Someone has to give. And that’s most likely going to be on the battlefield.If one side will begin to clearly win on the battlefield, that will be decisive. Military victory can bring the other side to real crisis — and maybe even regime change.This interview was slightly edited for clarity and brevity",0.08483,0.35867,11422,21,14,55,5,0

He earlier called the army’s top brass “bastards” who should be sent barefoot to the front with machine guns.The White House said last week that the Wagner Group had suffered more than 30,000 casualties since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with about 9,000 killed in action.About 90 percent of those killed in Ukraine since December were convicts, it said, a reference to Prigozhin’s recruitment of prisoner.Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov was appointed last month to run the war in Ukraine, and Sergey Surovikin, nicknamed “General Armageddon” by the Russian media, was demoted to deputy commander of the operation.Both men, unlike Shoigu, are career military officers.

51,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/20/389,"Washington, DC – Some right-wing United States Republicans are slamming Joe Biden’s visit to Ukraine, invoking crises at home that they accuse the president of ignoring as he pledges support for Kyiv.The opposition to Biden’s previously unannounced visit on Monday highlighted the views of a small but vocal cohort of ultraconservative US legislators who are sceptical of US support for Ukraine.First-term Republican Congressman Andy Ogles accused Biden of prioritising “political field trips” on Monday.“America-last Biden visited UKRAINE before visiting the people living through an environmental crisis in East Palestine, Ohio,” Ogles wrote on Twitter, referring to a toxic chemicals spill after a train derailment in Ohio earlier this month.Still, the trip earned praise from Democrats who lauded Biden’s “leadership” in supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion.Joe Biden visited Ukraine today before visiting the good people of East Palestine, Ohio.The Biden administration continues to put America last.— Congressman Ben Cline (@RepBenCline) February 20, 2023Many Republican critics noted that Biden left the country on Presidents’ Day, a US holiday honouring the country’s first president, George Washington. They also cited what they called a “crisis” at the US’s southern border, where record numbers of asylum seekers have arrived in recent months in search of protection.“Today on our President’s Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war,” far-right firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said in a social media post.Her fellow right-wing legislator Matt Gaetz quipped that Ukrainians “can keep” the US president.“When our border is in crisis, Joe Biden goes home to nap in Delaware,” Gaetz wrote on Twitter.“When Ohio burns with toxic chemicals, Biden’s admin says everything is fine. So on Presidents’ Day, I’m not surprised that Biden is ditching America for Ukraine.”Biden announced $500m in additional aid to Ukraine during his trip on Monday, part of a growing tally of assistance in the billions of dollars that Washington has provided to Kyiv since the invasion started last year.That continuing assistance has so far been approved by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – nearly one year ago – after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.Moscow’s war campaign has been mired by military setbacks, as Western powers continue to provide financial and military support to Kyiv. Russian officials have said that sending arms to Ukraine prolongs and intensifies the conflict.“Breathtaking that President Biden can show up in Ukraine to ensure their border is secure, but can’t do the same for America,” Republican Congressman Scott Perry said in a tweet on Monday.Most congressional Republicans still back US support for Ukraine, and many of them fault Biden for not being more aggressive against Russia.But Ukraine’s supporters fear that “America First” isolationism may be gaining a greater foothold in conservative politics ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.The Biden administration says it is committed to supporting Ukraine “as long as it takes” to help the country fight the Russian invasion.US officials say the aid is necessary not only for the sake of Ukrainian allies but also to preserve rules against unprovoked wars and protect the international order.In Kyiv, Biden described the Russian invasion as “brutal and unjust” as he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“One year later, Kyiv stands, and Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,” Biden said. “The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you.”Back in the US, many Democrats lauded Biden’s visit to Kyiv, which came days before the first anniversary of the invasion.Thankful for President Biden’s leadership as we continue to stand with Ukraine.🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦— Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) February 20, 2023Senator Cori Bush said in a social media post that Biden’s trip was a “reminder of the power of our presidency and how, when used responsibly, it can lift people up & be a beacon for freedom & democracy around the world”.Adam Schiff, a key House Democrat, said he was “proud” to see Biden express Washington’s “unbreakable” support to Kyiv.“We stand with the people of Ukraine in their struggle to push out Russian invaders, to enjoy the right of self-determination, and to live in peace,” Schiff wrote on Twitter.Democratic Congressman Jason Crow dismissed the Republican criticism of Biden’s visit.“These people know nothing about national security and foreign policy,” Crow told MSNBC.“They don’t understand that it’s in our strategic interests and our security interests and the American people’s interests to have a stable, prosperous and free Europe and a free world, and that’s what this fight is about.”",0.12778,0.35682,5068,18,4,8,1,1
52,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/20/us-in-no-position-to-make-demands-china-slams-blinken-comments,"Beijing has strongly denied US claims that China was considering arming Russia in its war against Ukraine as it called for “peace-loving” nations to act to end the conflict.A Chinese spokesperson said on Monday the United States is in no position to make demands after US top diplomat Antony Blinken warned Beijing against providing weapons to Russia in the war against Ukraine.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China “will never accept the US pointing fingers at Sino-Russian relations or even coercing us”.“It is the United States and not China that is endlessly shipping weapons to the battlefield,” Wang said. “We urge the United States to earnestly reflect on its own actions and do more to alleviate the situation, promote peace and dialogue, and stop shifting blame and spreading false information.”His comments come after Blinken expressed “deep concerns” about the “possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia”.“To date, we have seen Chinese companies … provide non-lethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support,” Blinken told CBS News after he met China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.Wang Wenbin said the US was “in no position to make demands of China”.He also pointed to Beijing’s “collaborative partnership” with Moscow, which he said was built on the basis of non-alignment and non-confrontation.‘A political solution’On the back of Blinken’s remarks, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that China potentially providing arms to Moscow “would be a red line” in the bloc’s relationship with Beijing.Borrell said he expressed his “strong concern” to Wang Yi and asked him to refrain from arms deliveries to Russia.“He told me that they are not going to do it, that they don’t plan to do it. But we will remain vigilant,” Borrell told journalists.Borrell, meanwhile, said the European Union needs to ensure Ukraine has enough ammunition to continue its fight against the Russian invasion.“It is the most urgent issue. If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger,” he said. “The Russian artillery shoots about 50,000 shots a day, and Ukraine needs to be at the same level of capacity. They have cannons but they lack ammunition.”Wang Yi – who is due to visit Russia this week on the one-year anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine – called for negotiations and peace for the sake of the world and Europe in particular.“We would like a political solution to provide a peaceful and sustainable framework to Europe,” Wang said in Hungary ahead of his visit to Moscow.Wang said the world was afflicted by disorder and wars and “peace-loving countries [should] bring the current hostilities to a halt as soon as possible”.Booming tiesIn February last year, shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, China promised a “no limits” partnership with Russia, which set off alarm bells in the West.China has refrained from condemning the war in Ukraine or calling it an “invasion”, blaming the US and NATO for provoking the Kremlin. It also denounced the sanctions imposed on Russia.Since the war started, Beijing and Moscow’s economic links have boomed as Moscow’s connections with the West have shriveled.The West has criticised China’s response to the Ukraine war with some warning a Russian victory would colour China’s actions towards Taiwan.Relations between the US and China have further deteriorated since Washington said China flew a spy balloon over the country before US fighter jets shot it down on President Joe Biden’s orders.",0.05143,0.3292,3679,9,10,13,0,0

He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong,” the statement quoted Biden as saying.As we approach the anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I'm in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelenskyy and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.— President Biden (@POTUS) February 20, 2023“Later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine,” the statement added.Biden said the US would provide Ukraine with additional assistance worth $500m that will include artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems and air surveillance radars. He also promised further sanctions against Russia.‘Important sign’Zelenskyy, who in December 2022 travelled to Washington, DC and addressed US Congress on his first trip abroad since the war began, wrote on Telegram that Biden’s visit was an “extremely important sign of support for all Ukrainians”.The Ukrainian leader said he and Biden spoke about “long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn’t supplied before”, but did not detail any new commitments.Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Kyiv, said the US president’s trip will be “very well received” by Ukrainians.“[Russian] President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to give a speech tomorrow,” Abdel-Hamid said.“People here are talking about a new offensive … a new buildup on the border in Russia and Belarus. So, certainly having the [US] president here pledging support, pledging weapons will make the Ukrainians feel that they can go ahead with this.”The trip allowed Biden to witness the damage that the Russian invasion has caused in Ukraine.Thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians have been killed in the past year, while millions have fled the fighting into neighbouring countries.Meanwhile, Sergei Markov, a Russian political scientist and former spokesman of Putin, claimed that Moscow had guaranteed Biden’s safety during the trip.“Joe Biden came to Kyiv only with personal guarantee for security from Vladimir Putin, that there will be no rocket and aviation strikes … during the visit,” Markov said.Al Jazeera was unable to verify his claim.Markov added the timing of the trip was significant as it comes before Putin’s state-of-the-nation address on Tuesday and days before the first anniversary of the invasion on Friday.But he argued that Biden had a lot to gain from the visit, in terms of domestic politics.“Leaders inside the [US] Democratic Party believe he’s not physically and mentally able” to carry out presidential duties, Markov said, adding that the trip was a “big victory” for Biden against his political opponents.Other Western leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, have also visited Kyiv in the past year.",0.01707,0.34134,3624,9,2,9,6,3
54,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/20/measuring-militaries-how-do-russia-and-ukraine-stack-up,"As the first anniversary of the war approaches on Friday, fighting is most intense in eastern Ukraine.Authorities in Kyiv, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have warned that a new Russian offensive is getting under way, and there are expectations that Ukrainian government forces are planning counterattacks in the coming spring – aided by new supplies of Western weapons.The next six months will see the nature of conflict change significantly.Both sides will push to take large amounts of territory and any offensive will cost that side dearly in terms of manpower.It remains to be seen whether Ukraine will bring its new weapons to bear in a way that will make a difference, and whether Kyiv’s troops can cross the Dnieper river in the south and assault Russia’s network of defensive lines in this vital sector that is key to the war.Russia, too, has to be seen to be winning, especially when so many lives are being sacrificed on the battlefield.While its military is adapting, it is questionable whether it can change enough and adopt new ways of fighting before its armies are destroyed.The loss of experienced Russian troops is being felt and it is now understood to be trying to rearm an increasingly citizen conscript military that might be more numerous, but less competent.What’s happening now?Despite a large influx of tens of thousands of new Russian conscripts, bolstered by units of airborne and marine infantry troops brought in from home bases near the Pacific Ocean, Moscow is still floundering in its push to retake Ukrainian towns in the eastern Donbas region.Bahmut in Donetsk remains Russia’s focal point.For months, Russia’s high command has extensively used Wagner Group mercenaries in the city, mainly convicts fighting for their freedom if they served in Ukraine.Human wave attacks, rarely effective in World War I, proved disastrous for the group.So total was the destruction that Russian prisoners refused to volunteer, the prison recruitment programme was shut down, and Wagner Group units were pulled from the front lines.Further south, Russia’s offensive to take Vuhledar has met equally fierce resistance.Russian armoured units were wiped out as a combination of Ukrainian artillery, clever mine emplacement and direct fire blunted attack after attack.(Al Jazeera)How do changes in the weather affect war?Most Russian attacks have taken place while the ground was hard and the temperatures sub-zero.Within a month though, this will change.A long period of rain will turn previously easily traversable fields into muddy quagmires, slowing movement to a crawl.This will not stop Russian attacks but it will force armour and infantry to keep to roads if they want to move quickly, making them easier to target and destroy.Wet weather would also affect any Ukrainian offensive planned for the spring.The south has been carefully fortified by Russian forces and Ukrainian troops would have to move swiftly over the wide open spaces of the region to avoid destruction out in the open.Deep mud and rain would hamper those efforts.Where are the pledged Western tanks?Newly promised Western tanks will take time to arrive in any numbers that would make a difference to the outcome of the war.Ukrainian crews need training if they are to leverage the higher quality optics and software that give tanks like the Leopard 2, Challenger 2 and Abrams such an advantage in battle.Ukraine is increasingly adopting Western digital mechanised logistics and warehousing.And it will need to, the increase of foreign weapons systems in Ukraine means keeping them running as effective military tools is as vital as training the tank crews.While they can be powerful weapons, if tanks lack fuel, spare parts or ammunition, they will become next to useless and can be easily destroyed on the battlefield.What are the dangers of a long war?The conflict does not look like it will end any time soon. Both Ukraine and Russia insist on victory conditions that are unacceptable to the other.Russia will not retreat unless forced to, Ukraine is unwilling to cede territory it has lost in the conflict and both sides say possession of Crimea by the other is a non-starter.President Zelenskyy has been clear that the war will continue till every part of Ukraine has been retaken.President Vladimir Putin is also aware that Crimea provides Russia with its only permanent warm water port, home to the powerful Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol.A resident rests as he walks with empty ammunition boxes on a street, as Russia’s attack on Ukraine continues, in the front-line city of Bakhmut, Ukraine [Yevhen Titov/Reuters]With compromise unlikely, other factors will start to play out.The ever-present possibility of Western donor fatigue will rise as NATO members contend with rising energy costs, increased defence budgets, and assistance given to allies such as Turkey over its devastating earthquake.If Ukraine is to prevail, a steady and increasing stream of high-tech weapons, ammunition, training centres and, in the long run, Western tanks and probably fighter jets, will be vital.Billions of dollars need to be spent and NATO’s pockets, while deep, are not limitless.As the conflict drags on, Russia’s military will start to adapt and learn from its many mistakes.Does Russia have the advantage?Russia has a long history of initial military failures, complete with incompetent leadership, poor training and bad equipment.The 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland ended in less than four months and was followed by disastrous battles when Germany invaded the Soviet Union.The war in Chechnya was a disaster for Russia in the beginning, but in each case, Moscow took the losses, learned from mistakes and fought better and harder – eventually overwhelming its opponent.Russia has a larger industrial base now and a much larger population to draw conscripts from than Ukraine.Its economy is not yet on a war footing, although moves have been made to increase weapons production.It can replace losses in manpower more readily than Ukraine, with its smaller population.Tactics are changing, too.In early February, for the first time, what appeared to be a surface kamikaze boat drone damaged a bridge in Ukraine.It was Russian, showing Moscow has built and deployed weapons that only Ukraine had used.Fast speedboats now accompany and protect Russian naval vessels in the Black Sea, ensuring they are not the targets of boat drones themselves.Playing to the strengths of conscripts who are best used in defensive operations, large intricate lines of trenches and fortifications have been built by the Russian army in the south.The flat featureless terrain will provide little cover for an attacking force and Ukrainian units will first have to cross the Dnieper river in the kinds of numbers that will make a difference to an offensive.Russia intends to make Ukraine fight for every metre of territory. Ukraine does, too.In a battle of attrition that drags on, Russia may well have the advantage in terms of manpower, since it can dramatically increase the size of its armed forces.Its industrial base is intact and well-funded while Ukraine has lost important sources of coal, steel and other supplies vital for war.The continued damage to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure not only makes the lives of Ukrainians miserable. Factories cannot be powered and steel cannot be smelted as industry falters and the country relies increasingly on foreign imports and goodwill.",0.02267,0.4257,7463,19,15,27,1,2

No such attack has materialised.Ukraine and its allies have dismissed such accusations as cynical attempts to spread disinformation, and have accused Moscow of planning incidents itself in a bid to blame Ukraine.‘Discussions will continue’Moscow’s allegations came as Ukrainian officials urged United States politicians to press US President Joe Biden’s administration to send F-16 fighter jets, saying the aircraft would boost Ukraine’s ability to hit Russian missile units.The lobbying came over the weekend on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in talks between Ukrainian officials, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, and Democrats and Republicans from the US Senate and House of Representatives.“They told us that they want [F-16s] to suppress enemy air defences so they could get their drones” beyond Russian front lines, said Senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut who flew US Navy fighters in combat.Biden last month said “no” when asked if he would approve Ukraine’s request for F-16s.Biden administration officials, speaking on Sunday, said the US should focus on providing weapons that can be used immediately on the battlefield, rather than fighter jets that require extensive training.But they did not categorically rule out providing F-16s.“Discussions will continue over the course of the next few weeks and months,” US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN.The conference – primarily focused on Ukraine – came days before the February 24 anniversary of Russia’s invasion. The sides have been locked in grinding battles, mostly in the eastern Donbas region, following a string of Russian defeats.Kelly said that while it requires at least a year of training to master all of the F-16’s capabilities, Ukrainian pilots could be taught to do “a limited number of things … in a few months”.‘Don’t worry about provoking Putin’Support is building on both sides of the Atlantic for providing Ukraine with advanced NATO-standard jet fighters. The United Kingdom says it would provide training.Both sides, however, have been reluctant to use their airpower in a significant way since the war began.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said US lawmakers broadly support training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and said he believed the Biden administration would soon agree to do so.He said he did not worry that the F-16s would escalate the conflict. “Don’t worry about provoking Putin; worry about beating him,” he said on broadcaster ABC News.Calls to supply Ukraine with advanced jets follow agreements last month by France, the UK, the US and Germany to supply Kyiv with modern battle tanks.Washington has provided some $30bn in military aid to Ukraine since the beginning of what Moscow calls its “special military operation”.Some Western officials have said that Ukraine’s allies should focus less on advanced fighter aircraft and more on basic logistics such as artillery shells.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell issued a stark warning about Ukraine’s dwindling supplies of bullets and similar munitions as it fights back against Russia’s invasion.“Ukraine is in a critical situation from the point of view with ammunition available,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to resolve quickly – it’s a matter of weeks.”Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged China is considering providing weapons to Russia, warning Beijing that any supplies would “cause a serious problem”.Blinken told CBS News that China was “considering providing lethal support” ranging “from ammunition to the weapons themselves”.‘Semi-encircled’As the debate over weapons supplies intensifies, Russian attacks continue.Ukrainian troops near the small town of Siversk, in the country’s east, said they were preparing to defend one of the possible targets of a new Russian offensive.Siversk, which had a prewar population of 10,000, is 35km (21 miles) north of Bakhmut – the scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks – and on a direct road to another of the key towns in the Donetsk region, Sloviansk.“If they occupied Bakhmut, then we would be semi-encircled, because on the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets River, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” said the deputy Siversk battalion commander, who used the nom de guerre “Han”.One soldier defending Siversk said Ukraine’s mostly Soviet-era artillery was outgunned by the enemy.“We have one artillery attack from our side and the Russians can do it five times more,” said 30-year-old Stefan. “It’s very difficult for the guys who are standing, especially at the first line [of defence]. They feel it too much.”Capturing Bakhmut would give Russian forces a stepping stone to advance on two bigger cities further west, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.But Ukraine and its Western allies say success there would be a largely symbolic victory for Moscow, given the time taken and losses sustained.",0.04712,0.36637,5738,16,4,14,2,0
57,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/19/chechen-leader-kadyrov-lauds-wagners-hard-work-in-ukraine,"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, says one day he plans to set up his own private military company in the style of the Wagner mercenary group.In a post on Telegram, Kadyrov said on Sunday that the Wagner Group, which has been fighting alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, had achieved “impressive results” and private military companies were a necessity.“We can say confidently that Wagner has shown its mettle in military terms and drawn a line under discussions about whether or not such private military companies are needed,” said Kadyrov, who has led the Chechen Republic since 2007.“When my service to the state is completed, I seriously plan to compete with our dear brother Yevgeny Prigozhin and create a private military company,” Kadyrov, 46, said. “I think it will all work out.”Kadyrov and Prigozhin lead forces in Ukraine that for the most part operate independently of Russia’s military command. Both men are staunch allies of Putin, but they have also spoken out in public against Russia’s military leadership.The rise of Wagner outside the traditional Russian military command structures has raised concerns among Western diplomats that such groups could one day pose a threat to stability in Russia.The Wagner Group has played an increasingly prominent role in Russia’s war in Ukraine, spearheading a months-long assault on the eastern city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.Kadyrov – son of former Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov, who was assassinated in a 2004 bombing in Grozny – has formed a tacit alliance with Prigozhin. They have been amplifying each other’s criticism of Russia’s military brass and calling for a more vigorous prosecution of the war.Prigozhin, who spent the final decade of the Soviet Union in prison for robbery and fraud, has been an associate of Putin’s for years.His catering company swept up government contracts, earning him the nickname of “Putin’s Chef”, while he deployed Wagner mercenaries to fight alongside Russian servicemen in Syria and to conflicts across Africa to advance Russia’s geopolitical interests.After years of denials, he last year admitted his links to Wagner and said he had interfered in US elections.Mounting evidence suggests the Kremlin has moved to curb what it sees as Prigozhin’s excessive political clout, ordering him to halt his public criticism of the defence ministry while advising state media to stop mentioning him or Wagner by name.Kadyrov said such groups were “both needed and necessary“.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.04399,0.33178,3230,3,2,10,4,0

We have to increase and accelerate our military support.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Western allies to speed up their military aid for Ukraine, warning attendees at the conference on Friday that delays would play into Russia’s hands as the invasion approaches its first anniversary.Borrell said he supports an Estonian proposal for the EU to buy ammunition on behalf of its members to help Ukraine.“I completely agree with the Estonian prime minister’s proposal, and we are working on that, and it will work,” Borrell said.The war in Ukraine has dominated discussions at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of security and defence officials from around the world.About 40 heads of state and government, other politicians and security experts from almost 100 countries are attending the three-day gathering as fears persist that the fighting in Ukraine could generate a new cold war.Ukraine depends on Western weapons to thwart Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambition to seize large areas of the country. The military aid has become a test of foreign governments’ resolve as its price tag increases.“There is no alternative to speed because it’s speed that life depends on,” Zelenskyy argued at the conference in Germany.EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the idea of joint procurement of 155mm artillery shells at a meeting in Brussels on Monday, Reuters news agency reported.Officials and diplomats from the EU say such an approach would be more efficient than EU members placing individual orders.Larger orders would also help the defence industry invest in extra capacity, they said.Russia hits back against US allegationsAlso on Sunday, Russia accused the United States of trying to “demonise” and foment the crisis in Ukraine with allegations of Russian crimes against humanity, Russia’s ambassador to the US said.Washington has formally concluded that Russia has committed “crimes against humanity” during its invasion of Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Saturday.“We regard such insinuations as an unprecedented attempt to demonise Russia in the framework of the hybrid war unleashed against us,” Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said in a statement on the Russian embassy’s Telegram page.“There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis,” he said.Organisations supported by the US Agency for International Development have documented more than 30,000 war crime incidents since the invasion, according to the US government.Ukrainian officials said their latest war crime investigation is over Thursday’s shelling of the eastern city of Bakhmut.The UN-backed Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says it has identified war crimes but has not concluded whether they amount to crimes against humanity.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.0811,0.3063,3824,9,8,9,1,2

61,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/18/us-russia-committing-crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine,"The United States has determined that Russia has committed “crimes against humanity” during its nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine, US Vice President Kamala Harris has said.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, days before the anniversary of Moscow launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Harris said Russian forces had conducted “widespread and systemic” attacks on the country’s civilian population.“In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity,” said Harris, a former prosecutor.“And I say to all those who have perpetrated these crimes, and to their superiors who are complicit in these crimes, you will be held to account.”The Biden administration formally determined last March that Russian troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine and said it would work with others to prosecute offenders.A determination of crimes against humanity goes a step further, indicating that attacks against civilians are being carried out in a widespread and systematic manner.Harris listed a litany of abuses that she said were carried out by Moscow’s forces in Ukraine – “gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation, execution-style killings, beatings and electrocution”.In her remarks, Harris cited as “barbaric and inhumane” the dozens of victims found in Bucha shortly after Russia’s invasion last February; the March 9 bombing of a Mariupol maternity hospital, that killed three people, including a child; and the sexual assault of a four-year-old by a Russian soldier that was identified by the UN in a report.Organisations supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have documented more than 30,000 war crime incidents since the invasion, according to the US government. Ukrainian officials said they were investigating the shelling of the city of Bakhmut this week as a possible war crime.Russia, which has said it is conducting a “special military operation” in Ukraine to eliminate threats to its security and protect Russian-speakers, has denied intentionally targeting civilians or committing war crimes.The official US determination, which came at the end of a legal analysis led by the Department of State, carried with it no immediate consequences for the continuing war.But Washington hoped that it could help further isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and galvanise legal efforts to hold members of his government accountable through international courts and sanctions.The UN-backed Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has not yet concluded that the war crimes it has said it has identified amount to crimes against humanity.Harris’s speech came as senior Western officials met in Munich to assess the conflict. The three-day conference is being attended by world leaders, including those from France and Germany, and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi.She said Russia was now a “weakened” country after Biden led a coalition to punish Putin for the invasion, but Moscow is only intensifying assaults in Ukraine’s east.Meanwhile, Ukraine is planning an offensive in the coming months, for which it is seeking more, heavier and longer-range weapons from its Western allies.The nearly year-long war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted millions from their homes, pummelled the global economy and made Putin a pariah in the West.The Biden administration has sought to bring alleged war criminals to justice, including training Ukrainian investigators, imposing sanctions, blocking visas and increasing penalties under US war crimes laws.Washington has spent some $40m on the efforts so far and says it is working with Congress to secure an additional $38m for the efforts.But the Biden administration’s ability to enforce any such efforts beyond its borders, and certainly within Russia, is limited. Collecting evidence in the war-torn country, too, has proven difficult.International legal bodies are also constrained. At the International Criminal Court, for instance, jurisdiction extends only to member states and states that have agreed to its jurisdiction, such as Ukraine but not Russia. Kyiv has been pushing for a new international war crimes organisation to focus on the Russian invasion, which Moscow has opposed.“If Putin thinks he can wait us out, he is badly mistaken,” Harris said. “Time is not on his side.”Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00873,0.32581,5107,10,11,13,4,0

63,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/18/russias-wagner-forces-suffered-30000-casualties-in-ukraine-us,"Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has suffered more than 30,000 casualties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last February, with about 9,000 of those fighters killed in action, the United States has claimed.The US estimates that 90 percent of Wagner Group fighters killed in Ukraine since December 2022 were convicts, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday.Half of the overall deaths among Wagner mercenaries have occurred since mid-December, as fighting in Ukraine’s eastern city of Bakhmut intensified, according to US intelligence.Kirby said the mercenary group had made incremental gains in and around Bakhmut over the last few days but those advances had taken many months to achieve and came at a “devastating cost that is not sustainable”.“It is possible that they may end up being successful in Bakhmut but it will prove of no real worth to them because it is of no real strategic value,” he said, adding that Ukrainian forces would maintain strong defensive lines across the Donbas region.Kirby told reporters that Wagner continued to rely heavily on convicts, who were sent to war without training or equipment, despite recent comments from Wagner’s founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that he had stopped recruiting Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine.The United Kingdom’s ministry of defence estimates Russian forces have likely suffered up to approximately 200,000 casualties since the start of their invasion of Ukraine.“The high Russian casualty rate, especially the high ratio of deaths to injuries, continues to have deleterious effects on the Russian military’s combat effectiveness and is likely prompting Russian officials to continue crypto-mobilization efforts,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Saturday.Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine – 17 February 2023Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/79EeudgP5j🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/XHzsXcaPNB— Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) February 17, 2023Meanwhile, Wagner chief Prigozhin has claimed the settlement of Paraskoviivka north of Bakhmut was completely controlled by his forces, the Russian agency Interfax reported on Friday.Russian military bloggers wrote that Paraskoviivka had been an important node of the Ukrainian defence lines. If the neighbouring villages of Verkhivka Berkhivka and Yahidne were also captured, the Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut could no longer be supplied from the north, the bloggers maintained.There was no independent confirmation of the Wagner chief’s claim and the Ukrainian general staff’s evening report did not mention the advance on Friday.The battle for Bakhmut has been raging for months.Prigozhin also used the Paraskoviivka announcement to take a jab at the Russian Defence Ministry, saying the Wagner advance had succeeded despite an “ammunition blockade”. The fighting, he said, had been attritional and bloody.Earlier on Friday, the Ukrainian government urged all Bakhmut residents to flee as heavy fighting is expected to continue.“If you are rational, law-abiding and patriotic citizens, you should leave the city immediately,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an appeal on Friday to what is believed to be the remaining few thousand people in the battered town. She made her comments on a Telegram channel.According to the Ukrainian government, five civilians were killed and nine injured earlier on Friday. The city of once 70,000 inhabitants in the Donetsk region now has about 6,000 civilians, Vereshchuk said.Many elderly residents are holding out because their homes are their only possession and they do not want to leave their birthplace.

64,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/17/zelenskyy-pushes-for-speedy-support-to-avoid-more-deaths,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Western allies to speed up their military support for Ukraine, warning that delays would play into Russia’s hands.“There is no alternative to speed because it’s speed that life depends on,” Zelenskyy said on Friday at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.Ukraine depends on Western weapons to thwart Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambition to seize control of large areas of the country. The military aid has become a test of foreign governments’ resolve as costs for the support rise at a time when they face high inflation and other economic problems.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged allies with Leopard battle tanks to send them immediately as efforts to equip Ukraine with the weapons stalled.“Those who can send such battle tanks should really do so now,” Scholz said at the conference, adding that he would be “intensively campaigning” for allies to move on the issue.Scholz’s call marked a dramatic reversal after he had come under pressure for months from allies to approve the delivery of the German-made tanks.Germany finally relented in January, saying it would itself send a company of 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks as it worked with allies to assemble two tank battalions for Ukraine.German officials have since indicated that they are disappointed that other countries have not offered more armour. The country is still waiting on some European partners to follow up with their own pledges.Scholz said Germany will do what it can “to make this decision easier for our partners”, for instance by training Ukrainian soldiers or helping with logistics.About 40 heads of state and government as well as other politicians and security experts from almost 100 countries are due to attend the three-day gathering in Munich as fears persist that the fighting in Ukraine could lead to a new cold war.Supplying Ukraine with billions of dollars of military aid has sometimes strained Kyiv’s allies. After receiving Western pledges of tanks and more ammunition, Ukraine is now hoping for fighter jets, but some countries have balked at sending them.Zelenskyy promised that his country would ultimately prevail over Moscow’s aggression – and even predicted that victory would happen this year. But he warned that Russia “can still destroy many lives.”“That is why we need to hurry up,” Zelenskyy said. “We need the speed.”Zelenskyy portrays Ukraine as defending Western values of freedom and democracy against tyranny and argues that his country needs to be properly equipped to fend off Russia’s much bigger force. Western countries have sided with him, but at times, they have been slow to meet his requests.For the first time in two decades, conference organisers did not invite Russian officials to Munich. It was the latest snub as Western countries seek to isolate Russia diplomatically over the full-scale invasion that began on February 24, 2022.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.01591,0.34386,3620,8,4,6,1,5
65,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/17/where-does-central-asia-stand-on-russia,"Kyiv, Ukraine – Serik Talipzhanov does not like Russia any more.The 32-year-old bank cashier lives in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s former capital and the financial hub of ex-Soviet Central Asia.The city is still largely Russian-speaking, and Talipzhanov, who can name several generations of his ethnic Kazakh forefathers, considers Russian his mother tongue.But his opinion about Kazakhstan’s former imperial master and beacon of soft power underwent an ideological U-turn in the past year, mostly due to the widely documented atrocities Russian servicemen committed in Ukraine.“I was very naive about Russia,” he told Al Jazeera by phone. “I always thought that even if politically things were getting worse up there, their culture made up for it.”But he and like-minded Kazakhs are still in the minority.Largely positiveOpinion polls about what Central Asians think about Russia are rare.The latest one was conducted in September by the Central Asian Barometer, a regional research group, only in Kazakhstan and neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.Only 28 percent of Kazakhs blamed Russia for starting the war, while 19 percent thought Ukraine was responsible, and one in 10 respondents said both nations shared the responsibility, the poll said.An overwhelming 87 percent of Kazakhs still had a “very” or “somewhat” favourable attitude towards Russia, and only 8 percent were negative about it.Similarly, 88 percent of respondents supported developing closer economic ties with Russia, while a meagre 6 percent opposed it.“The attitude to Russia is still largely positive,” said Temur Umarov, an analyst with Carnegie Politika, a Berlin-based think tank.But younger Kazakhs are the biggest sceptics, he said.“The younger those polled are, the worse is their attitude towards Russia” because they have access to independent and diverse online media, he told Al Jazeera.Another sobering factor is regular threats from Russian political figures to annex northern Kazakh regions that have a sizeable ethnic Russian minority.And that is where Beijing, whose economic clout in Kazakhstan has already surpassed that of Moscow, stepped in.In September, during a visit to Astana, the Kazakh capital, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to protect Kazakhstan’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.“No matter how the international situation changes, we will continue to resolutely support Kazakhstan in protecting its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, firmly support your ongoing reforms to ensure stability and development, and categorically oppose the interference of any forces in the internal affairs of your country,” Xi was quoted as saying.According to a Central Asian analyst, China’s support has meant Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev could distance himself a little from Moscow.“But one shouldn’t underestimate Russia’s remaining clout in the Central Asian region,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a London-based group, told Al Jazeera.However, since Moscow has been busy in Ukraine militarily and diplomatically, other powers have been vying for dominance in Central Asia, a mostly Muslim region of more than 60 million people.“A geopolitical vacuum emerged, China – and Turkey to a certain degree – rushed to fill it,” Ilkhamov said.China has invested tens of billions in the region, especially after launching the Road and Belt initiative to revive the Great Silk Road that crisscrossed the region centuries ago.In September, Chinese leader Xi also travelled to Uzbekistan to attend a security summit – and signed deals with Tashkent worth some $16bn – while Moscow’s accords with Central Asia’s most populous nation amounted only to $4.6bn.Moscow is trying to catch up, but Western sanctions and pressure force Russian companies to narrow down their investment niche in the region.“If there are Russian investments in Central Asian nations in the future, they will be concentrated in very narrow spheres, mostly energy,” analyst Umarov said.Energy projects are likely to attract most of the Russian investments because of the growing population in the region that once boasted the USSR’s highest birth rates – and its slow transition to natural gas from coal, he said.‘Brainwashed’The four remaining Central Asian stans still appear pro-Moscow.They do not share a border with Russia, and millions of Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik labour migrants flock northward in search of jobs, while their remittances keep their homelands’ economies afloat.Only Turkmenistan, a reclusive country whose residents need a hard-to-obtain permission to visit Russia, remains isolated amid squabbles about Turkmen natural gas exports via Russia.And, most importantly, Central Asian governments still allow the broadcasts of Kremlin-run television networks, while their domestic media outlets cannot offer an ideological alternative.“I can’t fathom how people can be brainwashed,” a resident of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.Her mother watches Russian news reports and television shows, and passionately supports the war.“I ran out of patience, it’s useless to argue with my mum. And since I don’t have another mum, we are silent about the war,” the resident said.Falling out of love with RussiaTalibzhanov, the Kazakh bank cashier, never liked Russian President Vladimir Putin and his policies, or Moscow’s influence on Kazakhstan’s politics and economy.But he enjoyed Russian rock and classical music and has hundreds of books in Russian on his mobile phone, including sci-fi novels by US authors such as Arthur Clarke and Ray Bradbury.He still downloads Western movies and television series with Russian voiceovers, and feels nostalgic about his visits to Moscow, where some of his childhood friends made careers and started families.But in April, he started reading news reports about the killing of civilians in Bucha, a suburb outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, that was occupied for several weeks.He could not believe them at first, but photos and videos of dead bodies lying on the streets and the evidence collected from survivors and Ukrainian officials convinced him Putin was a “monster”.“He either ordered all those war crimes to happen or is too weak to stop them from happening,” Talipzhanov said.His wife Zhanna agreed.“We grew up believing in the big Russian brother,” the 29-year-old nursery teacher told Al Jazeera.“These days, I can’t even imagine what would happen to Kazakh women if Russia invaded us,” she said.However, their change of heart does not mean they vilify each and every Russian.In December, they hosted Serik’s former classmate, an ethnic Russian who moved to the southwestern Russian city of Orenburg in 2015.The friend obtained a Russian passport, but fled fearing the “partial mobilisation” Putin announced last year to replenish the manpower lost in Ukraine.“He found a job and a place to stay here, but the dating scene is not that good so far,” Talipzhanov said. “He should stop telling young ladies that he lived in Russia.”",0.03086,0.29717,7028,5,7,33,3,0
66,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/17/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-putin-will-target-other-ex-soviet-states,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it is “obvious” that Ukraine would not be the last stop on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion and it is vital that the West not delay deliveries of weapons to help repel Russia’s forces.The Ukrainian leader told the Munich Security Conference by video link on Friday that while the West was negotiating supplies of tanks for Kyiv, the Kremlin was thinking of ways to “strangle” the former Soviet republic of Moldova just west of Ukraine.“It’s obvious that Ukraine is not going to be his last stop,” Zelenskyy said. “He’s going to continue his movement all the way, … including all the other states that at some point in time were part of the Soviet bloc.”Moldova, which is sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, has often been at the centre of a struggle between Moscow and the West. Tensions in Moldova have risen periodically, especially because of a Kremlin-backed breakaway region on its eastern border where Russia has stationed about 1,500 troops.On Monday, Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, said Moscow was plotting to overthrow her government and install an illegitimate one that “would put our country at the disposal of Russia in order to stop the European integration process”.She accused Russia of trying to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine.Zelenskyy said last week that his country had intercepted plans by Russian security services to destroy Moldova, claims that were later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.There was no immediate reaction from Moscow, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said this month that the West was considering turning Moldova into “another Ukraine”.‘Hurry up’On Friday, Zelenskyy also urged the West to maintain speedy weapons deliveries to his country.“Delay has always been and still is a mistake,” Zelenskyy said as he called on his allies to “hurry up”.He made his opening remarks in English as he addressed the security conference, an annual gathering of leading politicians, military officers, security officials and diplomats, a week before Ukraine marks the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion.Despite his warnings, Zelenskyy also said he did not think Russia could win.He likened Ukraine to David and Russia to Goliath in the biblical tale in which the underdog David, armed only with a sling, defeats a giant in combat. Zelenskyy said David won against Goliath by action rather than conversation and Goliath “has no chances”.“We need the speed – speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery to strengthen our sling, speed of decisions to limit Russian potential,” Zelenskyy said.French President Emmanuel Macron later urged Kyiv’s allies to “intensify” their backing for Ukraine’s counteroffensive as the West warns of a new Russian offensive to coincide with the war anniversary on February 24.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.01455,0.27515,3550,9,4,12,1,8

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron will also be attending the summit.Echoing a pattern of heavy aerial bombardment at times of Ukrainian battlefield or diplomatic advances, Russia launched 32 missiles in the early hours of Thursday, Ukraine’s air force said. Half were shot down, it added, a lower rate than usual.Russia has usually carried out its biggest waves of air attacks in daylight, striking energy facilities, but Ukrainian officials suggest Moscow is starting to adapt its strategy, including using air balloons for reconnaissance.Russia and Ukraine exchanged 101 prisoners of war in their latest prisoner swap, authorities said.Politics, sanctionsA top American trade official said that export controls on Russia have slowly reduced the supply of materials that it can use to rebuild its war machine.Israel will expand existing aid to Ukraine and help rebuild the country, foreign minister Eli Cohen said on Thursday during the first official Israeli visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion a year ago.NATO countries are ramping up production of artillery munitions as Ukraine is burning through shells much faster than the West can make them, the alliance said.European Union countries are “on good track” to adopt new sanctions against Russia in time for the February 24 one-year anniversary of its invasion, according to diplomatic sources.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Russia had never asked Belarus to go to war in Ukraine, and he would only order his troops to fight alongside ally Russia if another country attacked Belarus, state-run Belta news agency reported.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Polish President Andrzej Duda agreed on Thursday on the importance of stepping up support to Ukraine in the coming weeks, Sunak’s office said.Billionaire financier George Soros said that if Russia was defeated in the Ukraine war it would result in the dissolution of what he called the “Russian empire”, something he said would be greeted positively by former Soviet republics.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.07344,0.31674,2966,7,4,10,0,1

Ukraine said the barrage included three KH-31 missiles and one Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, which its air defences cannot shoot down. Meanwhile, Belarus, which allowed Russia to use its territory to send troops into Ukraine at the start of the war, said it would only fight alongside its ally if it was attacked.Bolstered by tens of thousands of reservists, Russia has intensified ground attacks across southern and eastern Ukraine, and a major new offensive appears to be shaping as the first anniversary of its February 24 invasion nears.Focus on BakhmutRussia’s current focus is on the small city of Bakhmut in Donetsk, one of two regions making up the Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland now partially occupied by Russia.In battles led by the Wagner group swelled by prison recruits, Russia has for months been pounding and attempting to encircle Bakhmut. Most of its pre-war population of about 70,000 people have left, leaving Ukrainian soldiers dug in.The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a stepping stone to advance on two bigger Donetsk cities further west, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. But Ukraine and allies say seizing Bakhmut would be a pyrrhic victory given the months it has taken and the huge losses they say Russia has sustained.In an interview with a pro-war military blogger, Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin forecast Bakhmut would fall by April, depending on how many men Ukraine threw into the fight and how well his men were supplied.“To take Bakhmut you have to cut all supply routes. It’s a significant task,” he said, adding: “Progress is not going as fast as we would like.”“Bakhmut would have been taken before the New Year, if not for our monstrous military bureaucracy,” he added.Prigozhin has previously accused the Russian military of attempting to “steal” victories from Wagner, a sign of his rising clout and the potential for dangerous rifts in Moscow.Speaking to Al Jazeera, Samuel Ramani an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute said this is not the first time Prigozhin has criticised Russia’s leadership.“I don’t think it’s very surprising that Prigozhin would lash out at Russian leadership in this manner,” Ramani said.“Russia wants victories and Yevgeny Prigozhin is just not delivering them,” Ramani said.As Ukraine burns through munitions fast and clamours for heavier firepower, including tanks and fighter jets, NATO members are ramping up production and promised more during meetings in Brussels this week.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s army has received vast amounts of aid. The United States alone has committed $27.4bn since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last February.Russia calls the invasion a “special military operation” against security threats and has cast deliveries of heavy weapons to Ukraine as proof that the West is escalating the war.Kyiv and its allies call Russia’s actions a war of aggression.In Brussels, diplomats said European Union countries were “on good track” to adopt a 10th package of economic sanctions against Moscow in time for the invasion’s anniversary, the Reuters news agency reported.",0.0872,0.42287,3830,12,5,16,0,1
69,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/16/russia-surrounds-bakhmut-as-ukraine-sends-in-troops,"Ukraine faced its toughest week so far this year on the eastern front, where its defenders lost more ground to Russian forces but committed enormous resources to holding Bakhmut, a coal-mining town that has acquired emblematic importance to both sides.Russian troops have been launching probing attacks on a wide front in Donetsk, half of which they now occupy. But their main effort has been to take Bakhmut, whose eastern outskirts they hold.“[We are] storming house by house, square metre by square metre. Hard work is going on,” said Yevgeny Prigozhin, the financier behind Wagner paramilitary company, which is heavily involved in the fighting for Bakhmut.But Russian forces have become bogged down in this fight, and in the 51st week of the war, they changed tactics.On February 9, it became apparent that Russia had begun an attempt to choke off Bakhmut from further resupply.“Blocking of Ukrainian supplies began in the area of Chasov Yar and Berkhovka,” a Russian military reporter said, referring to two settlements through which Bakhmut’s lines of communication run.“If this happens, Bakhmut will be in a tactical encirclement, and Ukrainian troops will be completely cut off from the supply of ammunition, medicines and fuel.”The next day Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Wagner forces appeared to have advanced 2-3km (1-2 miles) around the north of Bakhmut in three days – a remarkably rapid push in a battle where front lines have barely moved for months.It said they were now threatening the E40, Bakhmut’s northbound highway connecting it to Sloviansk.Russian news agency Tass quoted Donetsk officials as saying that Moscow’s forces were in control of “all” access roads to Bakhmut, including the local T0504, which runs into the city from the west.But the truth turns out to be more complicated.A Ukrainian military analyst said supplies were still getting through, something confirmed by Russian military reporter “Rybar”, who said Russian possession of the E40 and T0504 did not constitute operational encirclement.“Thanks to the network of branched ring roads in the fields between the main routes, Ukrainian formations almost unhindered transfer reinforcements to the crucible of the Bakhmut meat grinder,” Rybar wrote.Rybar also belied the claim that the E40 was taken or even under Russian fire control. He said Ukraine was preparing to tactically withdraw from Paraskoviivka in order to make a firmer stand at neighbouring Berkhovka, a way station on the E40 highway through which it was still able to supply Bakhmut with ammunition.Prigozhin confirmed the Ukrainian resupply of men and ammunition.“In all directions the enemy is becoming more active, pulling up more and more new reserves. Every day, from 300 to 500 new fighters approach Bakhmut in all directions. Artillery fire intensifies every day,” Prigozhin said.Russian forces attacked a semicircle of settlements north, northeast, south and west of Bakhmut on February 12-13 in an effort to complete their encirclement, but it was not working.“There are no conditions for encircling the enemy in the northern regions,” Prigozhin said.Prigozhin also told a military reporter that Russia was continuing to face stiff resistance in Bakhmut itself.“It is probably too early to say that we are close,” the Wagner chief said of taking Bakhmut. “There are many roads out and fewer roads in. Ukrainian troops are well trained.”Ukrainian eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said the two sides had clashed 17 times within Bakhmut on February 14, and reported hundreds of casualties on the Russian side, 205 killed and 217 wounded – a glimpse into the intensity of the fighting.Despite the obvious political importance, both sides were placing on Bakhmut, Ukraine publicly downplayed the battle.“The main goal of Russian troops remains to achieve at least some tactical success in eastern Ukraine,” Ukrainian military intelligence representative Andriy Chernyak told the Kyiv Post. But Russia lacked the manpower to mount anything resembling the February 24 invasion last year, he said.Russia did have some success in its encirclement effort.Krasna Hora fell to Wagner fighters on February 12, Prigozhin said. This was confirmed by pictures of Wagner Group fighters there.But as has happened before in this war, the claim of victory became a bone of contention between Wagner paramilitaries and the Russian defence ministry, which announced the capture the next day, saying “volunteers of assault detachments” took it.The battle for KreminnaOn February 15, Russia’s defence ministry claimed a breakthrough in the Luhansk region, at the northern end of the front. “During the offensive, Ukrainian troops randomly retreated to a distance of up to 3 km,” Russia’s defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said “attacks are coming from different directions in waves”, though he denied that Russian forces had reached the administrative border of the Luhansk region.The attack may have come from Kreminna, where days earlier the Institute for the Study of War had said Russia was sending a better class of equipment to facilitate an advance towards Lyman, in Donetsk, a city Russia lost to a Ukrainian counteroffensive last September.The Russian defence ministry said it was deploying the TOS-1 thermobaric multiple launch rocket system to the area, and posted footage showing a destroyed Russian BMPT “Terminator” armoured fighting vehicle 8km (5 miles) south of Kreminna.Russian forces had made incremental advances on the northern end of the front the previous day. Geolocated images showed Russian tanks operating in Ploshchanka, just north of Kreminna, where Ukrainian forces said they expected a new offensive.Haidai said Russian forces and equipment were amassing there.“They see this task as the easiest, which is why they are preparing a massive offensive,” he wrote.“We see how they are sending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. “The reality is that we are seeing the start [of a new offensive] already.”Divisions within the allianceA Washington Post story on February 13 leaked disagreements between senior US officials and Ukraine on prioritising Bakhmut.“American military analysts and planners have argued that it is unrealistic to simultaneously defend Bakhmut and launch a spring counteroffensive to retake what the United States views as more critical territory,” the Post story said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the moral blow of losing Bakhmut would be great, and has decided to prioritise its defence.Unnamed sources in the Post story were also quoted as warning that US military aid might not be sustained at present levels for long.“We will continue to try to impress upon them that we can’t do anything and everything forever,” a senior administration official reportedly said. “’As long as it takes’ pertains to the amount of conflict,” the official said. “It doesn’t pertain to the amount of assistance.”The report earned a stern rebuke from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken the next day.“If we ratify the seizure of land by another country and say ‘that’s okay, you can go in and take it by force and keep it’, that will open a Pandora’s box around the world for would-be aggressors that will say, ‘Well, we’ll do the same thing and get away with it,'” Blinken told NPR’s Morning Edition.Leaking any signs of weakness in the alliance supporting Ukraine was also folly, said a leading strategy professor.“You DON’T telegraph to the world – and above all to the Russians – that you are getting ready to undercut your dependent ally,” tweeted Eliot A Cohen, professor of foreign and defence policy at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. “An attempt to impose on Ukraine a deal with Russia that reinforces their losses would not merely be immoral: it would be an act of strategic imbecility.”Ukraine has said it means to eject Russia from all the territory it has occupied since 2014, including the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, as well as Crimea.Some US and European officials are uneasy about that, believing it would trigger a violent response, perhaps including the use of nuclear weapons by Russia.For example, with the war drawing towards its one-year mark, Europe’s leaders announced their support for Ukraine “remains unwavering”, and that they will continue to provide military support to Ukraine “for as long as it takes”.But they defined the goal of that aid vaguely, as “a just peace based on respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, not a return to the borders of Ukraine Russia recognised in 1991.An air war?Zelenskyy ended a tour of London, Paris and Brussels on February 9, requesting fourth-generation F-16 fighter jets.The US has said it will not provide them, although some of Ukraine’s other allies have indicated they might.Speaking to those allies gathered in Brussels on February 14, US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said there was a real danger that Russia would now bank on its superiority in the air, but that Ukraine’s response should be air defences.“We do know Russia has substantial aircraft … and a lot of capability left,” said Austin. “We want to make sure they have the ability to protect themselves in the event Russia decides to introduce its air force into the fight.”“The Russian land forces are pretty depleted so it’s the best indication that they will turn this into an air fight,” two defence officials told the Financial Times. “If the Ukrainians are going to survive they need to have as many air defence capabilities and as much ammunition … as possible.”",0.08532,0.3434,9690,14,8,35,0,2
70,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/16/mapping-where-every-country-stands-on-the-russia-ukraine-war,"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began nearly a year ago, the world has been broadly categorised into three camps – countries allied with Ukraine, those impartial to the conflict, and the nations that have defended Russia.While the United States and European Union states have provided military assistance to Ukraine totalling more than $100bn, other countries have chosen to make their positions known by imposing sanctions on Russia or with their votes at the United Nations.In the following series of infographics, Al Jazeera breaks down the political, military and economic positions of various countries.Political stanceOne way of knowing where a country stands politically is by looking at how they vote at the United Nations.The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) comprises 193 member states and is the most representative body of the UN system. Every member state is allowed an equal vote when deciding on resolutions.Resolutions passed by the UNGA are non-binding, which means they have no legal power. Rather, they are viewed as an expression of the will of the international community on a given topic.Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UN convened its first emergency session in 25 years. The 193-member assembly has since voted on four special resolutions addressing various concerns with regard to Ukraine.The map below summarises how these countries voted across these four special resolutions. Countries that voted in favour of all resolutions (102 countries):Note: An asterisk* means this country was absent from at least one vote.Afghanistan*, Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Benin*, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Comoros*, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, DRC, Denmark, Djibouti*, Dominica*, Dominican Republic, East Timor, Ecuador, Estonia, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lebanon*, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania*, Mauritius, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco*, Myanmar, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda*, Saint Lucia, Samoa, San Marino, São Tomé and Príncipe*, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands*, Somalia*, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Bahamas, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Zambia*.Countries that voted in favour or abstained in at least one resolution (47 countries):Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bhutan, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau*, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, South Sudan, Suriname, Thailand, The Gambia, Togo*, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Yemen.Countries that voted to abstain in all resolutions (16 countries):Armenia*, Cameroon*, El Salvador*, Equatorial Guinea*, Eswatini*, Guinea*, India, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda.Countries that voted against or abstained in at least one resolution (19 countries):Algeria, Bolivia, Burundi, Central African Republic, Cuba, Eritrea, Ethiopia*, Iran*, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mali, Nicaragua, China, Republic of the Congo, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan*, Vietnam, Zimbabwe.Countries that voted against all resolutions (4 countries):Belarus, North Korea, Russia, Syria.Countries that were absent in all resolutions (4 countries):Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan, Venezuela.Gabon was the only country to vote in favour or against a resolution.A detailed breakdown of each of the resolutions is listed below:Emergency Session 1 – Demand that Russia withdraw its military forces from UkraineIn favour: 141   |   Against: 5   |   Abstain: 35On March 2, 2022, 141 countries voted in favour of a UN resolution demanding that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally” withdraw its military forces from Ukraine. The resolution needed a two-thirds majority of yes/no votes to pass.China, India, Iran and South Africa were among the 35 countries that abstained, while just five – Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria and of course Russia – voted against it. Twelve countries including Venezuela, which have been suspended for two years for failing to pay dues due to the UN, were absent from the vote.(Al Jazeera)Emergency Session 2 – Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against UkraineIn favour: 140   |   Against: 5   |   Abstain: 38In a second resolution adopted on March 24, almost three-quarters of the UNGA voted to demand aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine – and criticised Russia for creating a “dire” humanitarian situation.The resolution, which was drafted by Ukraine and its allies, received 140 votes in favour and five votes against by the same countries – Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Russia and Syria – while 38 countries abstained. Ten countries were absent from the vote.Emergency Session 3 – Suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights CouncilIn favour: 93   |   Against: 24   |   Abstain: 58On April 7, a US-sponsored resolution to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was adopted with 93 votes in favour, 24 against and 58 abstentions. The resolution required a two-thirds majority to pass, not counting abstentions.The resolution came after the discovery of civilian bodies in the town of Bucha near Kyiv.The Russian delegation announced it had quit the Human Rights Council earlier that day in expectation of the vote. The UNHRC is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights globally.Emergency Session 4 – Territorial integrity of Ukraine, condemning Russia’s move to annex parts of UkraineIn favour: 143   |   Against: 5   |   Abstain: 35In late September, Russia formally announced the annexation of four partially occupied provinces of eastern and southern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies rejected the vote as meaningless and illegal.On October 12, the UN General Assembly voted to condemn Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of the four partially occupied regions in Ukraine and urged countries not to recognise the move. Three-quarters of the 193-member General Assembly — 143 countries — backed the resolution that also reaffirmed the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.Four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution – Belarus, Nicaragua, North Korea and Syria. Another 35 countries abstained from the vote, including China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. The rest did not vote.Interactive: UN votes to condemn Russia’s annexationsCountries arming UkraineAccording to the latest data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, at least 32 countries have provided Ukraine with military assistance including weapons, equipment or financial aid for the army.Twenty-five of the 32 nations providing military assistance are part of NATO – the world’s largest military alliance with 30 member states. Notably missing from this list is Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close relations with Russia.Countries which have supplied Ukraine with weapons and military equipment include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.The list above does not include countries providing non-lethal aid or fuel. Some nations may have also kept their transfers secret.Military aid sent to Ukraine includes conventional weapons as well as more advanced equipment and modern weaponry.The weapons include artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, anti-tank weapons, armoured vehicles, reconnaissance and attack drones, helicopters, small arms, ammunition and body armour.In January, the US, UK and Germany pledged to send modern main battle tanks to Ukraine. The UK said it would deliver 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, Germany agreed to send 88 Leopard tanks, and the US said it would send dozens of its M1 Abrams to bolster the country’s war effort.Analysts say the latest-generation main battle tanks are vital for Ukraine in order to punch holes in Russian defensive lines and retake territory that Moscow seized in the opening weeks of the invasion.NATO and its allies have also trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, including special forces.Countries providing aid to UkraineAccording to the Kiel Institute, 40 countries have committed at least 108bn euros ($115bn) in financial, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine between January 24 and November 20, 2022.At 47.8bn euros ($51.2bn) in commitments, the US is Ukraine’s biggest contributor, with at least 22.9bn euros ($24.5bn) going towards military pledges, 15.05 billion euros ($16.1bn) in financial aid and 9.9 billion euros ($10.6bn) in humanitarian assistance.Humanitarian relief covers medical, food and other items for civilians, while financial assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and guarantees.European Union institutions including the EU Commission, EU Council and the European Investment Bank, are the second-highest contributors with 34.9bn euros ($37.3bn) pledged to Ukraine, while the UK is third at 7.1bn euros ($7.6bn).Since November 20, the US and other countries have pledged additional military packages to Ukraine. The chart below provides a detailed breakdown of how much each country has committed to Ukraine.Countries sanctioning RussiaAt least 46 countries or territories have imposed sanctions on Russia, or pledged to adopt a combination of US and EU sanctions according to Castellum.ai, a global sanctions-tracking database. Since February 22, more than 11,327 sanctions have been slapped on Moscow, making Russia the most sanctioned country in the world.Eighty percent of all sanctions target individuals while 18 percent target entities. The remaining sanctions target vessels and aircraft.The US has imposed the most number of sanctions on Russia at 1,948 followed by Switzerland (1,782), Canada (1,590), the UK (1,429) and the EU (1,390).(Al Jazeera)",0.02375,0.2894,10740,28,2,24,0,0
71,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/16/after-a-year-of-war-in-ukraine-what-might-happen-next,"Almost a year has passed since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine for a full-scale invasion that several world leaders had warned of.The February 24 anniversary will bring a sense of mourning for Ukrainians. Many are grieving their relatives and all will remember the devastation that has rocked their country, as they reflect on what lies ahead.Thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including at least hundreds of children, and tens of thousands of troops on both sides have been killed. The exact tolls are hard to confirm, and most estimates are understood to be massively underestimated.Millions of others were forced to flee from their homes in search of safety.Looking ahead, there are fears of a wider conflict possibly involving nuclear warheads as relations between Russia and Ukraine’s allies in the West, which have worsened from lows as the war has raged, sink further.Here’s what you need to know about the conflict as it enters a second year.Why did the war start?President Vladimir Putin launched Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early hours of February 24 last year.In an address that morning, he described the offensive as a “special military operation”, saying the goal was to “demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine”.He argued that Ukraine’s government had been subjecting Russian-speaking civilians in the eastern Donbas region to “genocide” since 2014.That’s the year Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and Moscow-backed separatists tried to break away from Kyiv’s control by seizing territory and setting up self-declared eastern states in the Donbas – the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republic (DPR and LPR).Most of the world still recognises Crimea, DPR and LPR as Ukrainian lands, but in the years since 2014, about 14,000 people died in a simmering conflict between Ukrainian government forces and rebels supported by Russia.How many were killed on each side is hard to confirm, but few would agree with Putin’s use of the word “genocide”.Putin’s “de-Nazify” comment – which has persisted throughout the war – was in reference to the Azov Batallion, a Ukrainian brigade rooted in far-right ideology, comprising volunteers who had fought against the separatists in the east. The group is now known as the Azov Regiment and some of its fighters have since rejected the far-right label.On February 24, the Russian president also linked the invasion to the United States-led NATO transatlantic military alliance. He said Russia was intent on preventing NATO from expanding further eastwards and gaining a “military foothold” in Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union prior to its collapse in 1991.Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected all of Russia’s rationales.They say the war was unprovoked and aimed at seizing land and subjugating Ukraine. NATO has not moved to admit Ukraine as a member and says it is a purely defensive alliance.Which nations support each side?Ukraine’s allies are mostly in the West.The US, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and Australia, among others, have all backed Kyiv with billions of dollars worth of military and humanitarian aid.Many NATO allies have been at the forefront of efforts to arm Kyiv with weaponry capable of repelling Russia’s forces.Russia’s main backer is its neighbour and close ally, Belarus. Russia’s military used Belarusian territory as a launchpad for the invasion.Moscow’s ex-Soviet Central Asian allies are treading a careful line. Over the year, most have called for peace and kept diplomatic ties with Russia, but analysts say a sense of worry is palpable as a war started by Russia, where Soviet power was established, grips a nation with a similar political history.At the same time, many countries – such as China, India and Turkey – have avoided fully supporting either side.How many people have been killed?According to a February 13 United Nations report, at least 7,200 civilians, including hundreds of children, have been killed since Russia launched its invasion.The true toll is likely to be considerably higher as continuing fighting hampers efforts to count the dead.Tens of thousands of troops on both sides have also been killed, but again, the casualties are likely to be higher – according to Western officials, hundreds of thousands of soldiers have died.Neither side provides reliable figures for their own war dead.Outside Ukraine, the war has piled misery on millions of people suffering from acute food and energy crises. Ukraine and Russia are traditionally global exporters of food and the conflict has heavily disrupted supply chains.Russia is also an exporter of energy – namely oil and gas – and has slashed supplies to the West in response to waves of sanctions, fuelling inflation and deepening cost-of-living crises in Europe, in particular.What has happened so far?At the outset of its invasion, Russia poured soldiers – an estimated 200,000 of them – into Ukraine from the north, east and south.They captured vast swaths of territory and pressed towards the outskirts of Kyiv.But Russian troops failed to seize the capital.By the end of March, Ukrainian counterattacks had successfully pushed Russian units back in the north and south, retaking some areas and revealing atrocities carried out by occupation forces in places such as Bucha, a Kyiv suburb,Forced into retreat, Moscow’s troops regrouped in Ukraine’s east and Putin recast the Kremlin’s goal as “the liberation of Donbas”.Months of fighting along southern and eastern fronts followed. Moscow moved in late September to unilaterally annex four partly occupied territories – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia – a move widely denounced as a meaningless tactic.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces aided by Western arms supplies were busy staging sweeping counterattacks. By mid-November, the Ukrainians had recaptured the southern city of Kherson – the only regional capital Russian troops had seized since the outset of the war – a humiliating defeat for Moscow.Since then, both sides have been locked in bloody battles for control of territory in the Donbas, which is made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.What might happen next?Ukrainian officials believe Russia is beginning a renewed offensive to coincide with the first anniversary of the war.They fear Moscow may deploy hundreds of thousands of conscripts it mobilised late last year in an attempt to turn the tide of the conflict in its favour, perhaps even staging another attempt to capture Kyiv.Ukraine is preparing itself for new attacks, emboldened by enhanced Western military support in the shape of longer-range missiles and battle tanks.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his government’s goal is not just to fend off offensives, but also to retake all Ukrainian territory captured by Russia, including Crimea.Kyiv has pleaded with its Western allies for more military support to rid Ukraine of Russia’s invasion forces, with its most recent requests focused on F16 fighter jets.Ben Wallace, the British foreign secretary, recently told The Sun newspaper that the world should “expect Russians to step up their indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas”, adding that Putin on the war anniversary “will lash out and kill more innocent people”.And at the start of this month, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov ominously warned in an interview with state media that Western events marking the anniversary “will not turn out to be the only events that will gain the world’s attention”.",0.04011,0.34675,7450,15,15,26,5,1

73,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/15/ukraine-shoots-down-russian-reconnaissance-balloons,"Six Russian balloons were spotted over Kyiv and most were shot down after being engaged by air defences, the Ukrainian capital’s military administration said.The balloons may have been carrying corner reflectors and reconnaissance equipment, but officials did not specify when they flew over the capital, although air alerts were issued in Kyiv on Wednesday.“According to information that is now being clarified, these were balloons that move in the air under the propulsion of wind,” the military administration wrote on the Telegram messaging app.“The purpose of launching the balloons was possibly to detect and exhaust our air defences.”Shortly before the announcement, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February of last year, could be using balloons in a new drive to preserve its stocks of reconnaissance drones.“Reconnaissance drones like the Orlan-10 are now being used more sparingly [by Russia], and they thought, ‘Why don’t we use these balloons?’ So they are using them,” Ihnat told Ukrainian television.He later confirmed that air raid sirens blared in the capital on Wednesday because of balloons flying overhead.Russia did not immediately comment on the reports of balloons over Kyiv.‘Inflicted considerable attrition’Other than a shortage of drones, Russia has lost about half of its battle tanks since the invasion of Ukraine a year ago, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said.But the research centre also noted on Wednesday that Moscow has preserved its air force largely intact and may deploy it more actively in the next phase of the war.In its annual Military Balance report, a key reference tool for defence experts, IISS said loss rates for some of Russia’s most modern classes of tank were as high as 50 percent, forcing it to rely on older Soviet-era models.The institute’s Ben Barry, a land warfare expert, said the equipment losses were “quite serious” for Russia’s military.He noted both the Norwegian and Estonian intelligence services recently released a report saying the immediate threat to their nations is “greatly reduced” because of the way the Ukraine war “has sucked in Russian forces and inflicted considerable attrition on them”.“But we should remember much of the Russian air force – and outside the Black Sea much of the Russian navy – remains extant. When intelligence agencies say Russia is still a clear and present danger to Western Europe, I think they’re right,” Barry told Al Jazeera.‘Less confident’Henry Boyd, a research fellow at IISS, estimated Russia’s tank losses to be between 2,000 and 2,300, and Ukraine’s to be up to 700.Ukraine has secured promises of about 100 modern Western tanks, including the US Abrams, the German Leopard, and the British Challenger, whose capabilities far exceed that of older Russian models.“That may well then translate through to less aggressive and less confident [Russian] tank actions as crews are more concerned about the threat level presented to them,” Boyd said.Ukraine’s air force, meanwhile, has suffered a 28 percent attrition rate, the report said.IISS aerospace expert Douglas Barrie said Russia had preserved its air force mostly unscathed, operating at a distance because of effective Ukrainian air defences and an undersupply of tactical short-range air-to-surface missiles.‘Another bloody year’But Barrie said Russia may look to use air power more actively, and potentially take more risks to hit any concentrations of Ukrainian forces on the ground.“One of the challenges from a Ukrainian perspective is if they do either have to repel a significant Russian ground force or mass their own forces … you leave yourself vulnerable to air attack,” he said. “At that point, the Russians might decide they’re going to take greater losses just to inflict yet greater losses on the other side.”As Russia intensifies its attacks ahead of the one-year invasion anniversary, Barry said he was sceptical its forces can make major progress.“My assessment is it’s going to find it difficult to concentrate enough credible and competent force to push the Ukrainians back much,” he said. “[But] it’s not clear to me that Kyiv has enough combat power to rapidly eject Russian forces … We can expect another bloody year.”",0.09232,0.38793,4291,6,3,20,0,0
74,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/15/russian-journalist-sentenced-to-penal-colony-in-dissent-crackdown,"A Russian journalist was sentenced to six years in a penal colony after accusing the Russian air force of bombing a theatre in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol last year.According to court documents released on Wednesday, the Lenin district court in the Siberian city of Barnaul also banned Maria Ponomarenko, 44, from working as a journalist for five years.The court found Ponomarenko, who worked for the RusNews portal, guilty of “spreading false information about the Russian armed forces’ actions” with her posts on a messaging app.“Patriotism is love for the motherland, and love for one’s motherland should not be expressed by encouraging crime,” Ponоmarenko told the court before her sentencing, according to the RusNews outlet. “Attacking your neighbour is a crime.”People walk past the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine, March 16, 2022 [File: Alexei Alexandrov/AP Photo]The Europe and Central Asia coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, Gulnoza Said, issued a statement on Ponomarenko’s sentencing.“Russian authorities should be ashamed of the six-year prison sentence given to journalist Maria Ponomarenko, whose sole so-called crime was publishing information about the war in Ukraine that did not conform to the official narrative.“Authorities should not contest Ponomarenko’s appeal, drop all the charges against her, and stop jailing independent voices.”The verdict is the latest in a series of rulings in Russia that ban criticism of the war.In the early days of the conflict, the Kremlin approved legislation that penalised the spread of “false information” or criticism about the country’s military campaign, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”.Some members of Russia’s political opposition, activists, journalists, and bloggers have previously been convicted and imprisoned under the law.In December, prominent opposition politician Ilya Yashin was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. Earlier last year, Alexei Gorinov, a member of a Moscow municipal council, received a seven-year sentence for his critical remarks about the hostilities in Ukraine.Another leading opposition figure, Vladimir Kara-Murza, has been in custody awaiting trial on the same charge.Mariupol theatre attackThe Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre in Mariupol was destroyed by an air strike that killed 300 people on March 16, 2022, after it was used as a safe haven.Kyiv has previously accused Russia of targeting the theatre. Moscow denies the allegation and says Ukrainian nationalists blew it up.An investigation by human rights group Amnesty International found Russian forces guilty of a war crime after striking the theatre. Russia says it goes to great lengths to avoid hurting civilians. ",0.0344,0.33565,2758,3,3,9,0,0
75,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/15/infographic-how-much-have-nato-members-spent-on-ukraine,"Just days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there are growing signs that a major new Russian offensive has already begun.“We see how they [Russia] are sending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.Russia has accused the United States-led military alliance of “direct and growing” involvement in the conflict by providing the Ukrainian government with tens of billions of dollars worth of military assistance, including battle tanks, over the past year.In his comments to reporters ahead of a NATO defence ministers’ meeting, Stoltenberg said the issue of supplying combat aircraft was on the table but stressed that such a development would not make member countries part of the war.NATO history and expansionNATO, the acronym for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the world’s largest military alliance.It was founded in 1949 by 12 member states – Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the US – with the aim of curbing Soviet expansion and encouraging political integration in Europe.Between 1950 and 1999, seven more countries – Greece, Turkey, West Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland – joined the alliance.The expansion continued in 2004 when seven Eastern European states – Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, joined the military bloc. Of those, all but Slovenia were part of the Warsaw Pact – a defence treaty created in 1955 between the Soviet Union and seven satellite states.Today, NATO comprises 30 nations. Only six members of the 27-country European Union (EU) are not NATO members: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden.Russian President Vladimir Putin has frequently referred to NATO’s eastward enlargement as a reason for the conflict in Ukraine. NATO’s 2023 budgetEvery year, NATO sets its military and civil budgets, with all member countries pledging to contribute to the budget based on a cost-sharing formula derived from the gross national income of each country.NATO members have committed a minimum of two percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to defence spending to continue to ensure the alliance’s military readiness, but most countries have over the years been missing the target.For 2023, the military budget was set at 1.96 billion euros ($2.10bn), representing a 25.8 percent increase compared with last year.The US and Germany have pledged to equally contribute the highest percentage to the military budget, together totalling more than 30 percent of the alliance’s funds.Sweden and Finland’s bid to join NATOOn May 16, 2022, Sweden officially applied to join NATO. Two days later, Finland followed suit.On July 5, NATO ambassadors signed the accession protocols to allow Sweden and Finland to join the alliance.Between July and September, 28 NATO members except for Hungary and Turkey approved Sweden and Finland’s accession. NATO requires unanimous approval from all of its existing members to admit new members.Turkey has demanded that the Nordic countries stop supporting Kurdish armed groups, such as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), and lift their bans on the sales of some arms to Turkey.In January, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated that Ankara may agree to Finland joining NATO, but not Sweden, in the face of rising tensions with Stockholm.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close relations with Putin, has promised that his parliament would approve the two bids next month.Finland shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia. While Sweden does not have a land border with Russia, it does share a maritime border with the country in the Baltic Sea.Russia has firmly opposed Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO, seeing it as further encroachment of the transatlantic alliance towards Russia’s borders.How much aid have NATO members sent to Ukraine?According to the latest data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, NATO members committed at least 75.2 billion euros ($80.5bn) in financial, humanitarian and military aid between January 24 and November 20, 2022.At 47.8 billion euros ($51.2bn) in commitments, the US is Ukraine’s biggest contributor, with at least 22.9 billion euros ($24.5bn) going towards military pledges, 15.05 billion euros ($16.1bn) in financial aid and 9.9 billion euros ($10.6bn) in humanitarian assistance.Military assistance includes weapons, equipment and financial aid for the Ukrainian military. Humanitarian relief covers medical, food and other items for civilians, while financial assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and guarantees.The UK is the second-highest NATO member contributor with 7.1 billion euros ($7.6bn) pledged to Ukraine, while Germany is third at 5.4 billion euros ($5.8bn).Non-members Sweden and Finland have committed at least 810 million euros ($867m) and 310 million euros ($332m), respectively.Since November 20, the US and other countries have pledged additional military packages to Ukraine. The chart below provides a detailed breakdown of how much each NATO member country has committed to Ukraine.Which weapons have NATO members provided Ukraine?Since the start of the war on February 24, NATO member countries have sent both conventional weapons as well as more advanced equipment and weaponry to Ukraine.These include:Westland Sea King helicoptersIRIS-T air infrared-guided air defence systemsJavelin anti-tank missilesHowitzersSwitchblade dronesHigh mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS)National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS)T-72 tanks and missilesNext-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs)Multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS)Caesar self-propelled gunsLeopard 1 and 2 tanksModern tanks and advanced fighter jetsIn January, the US, UK and Germany each pledged to send modern main battle tanks to Ukraine. The UK said it would deliver 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, Germany agreed to send 88 Leopard tanks, and the US said it would send dozens of its M1 Abrams to bolster the country’s war effort.Analysts say the latest-generation main battle tanks are vital for Ukraine in order to punch holes in Russian defensive lines and retake territory that Russian forces seized in the opening weeks of the invasion.Southern Ukraine is flat and ideal tank territory. Russia has been building rows of trenches and fortified bunkers to stop a Ukrainian advance in the area.In addition to tanks, Ukraine has also been pushing for Western fourth-generation supersonic fighter jets, including the US-made F-16.Ukraine’s air force has a fleet of ageing Soviet-era aircraft that came off the assembly line before it even declared independence more than 31 years ago. The jets are used for intercept missions and to attack Russian positions.The UK, US and France have not ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine, though Germany has.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said there was no chance of fighter jets being sent to Ukraine. Scholz said Western allies would keep supporting Ukraine, but he also highlighted the danger of further inflaming the conflict.NATO and its allies have also trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, including special forces.Ukraine has long expressed interest in joining NATO. In 2019, it adopted a constitutional amendment to pursue membership of the alliance.While Ukraine is not expected to join NATO any time soon, in December Stoltenberg said that “Russia does not have a veto” on countries joining and that the alliance “stand[s] by that, too, on membership for Ukraine”.",0.08684,0.27927,7645,20,7,14,2,0

77,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/15/possible-war-crime-as-russia-holds-thousands-of-children-study,"Russia has held at least 6,000 Ukrainian children — and probably many more — in Russian-occupied Crimea and Russia itself in actions that might constitute a war crime, according to a new study backed by the United States.Researchers from the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said they had identified at least 43 camps and other facilities where Ukrainian children as young as four months old were held and whose “primary purpose” appeared to be political reeducation.“Multiple camps endorsed by the Russian Federation are advertised as “integration programs”, with the apparent goal of integrating children from Ukraine into the Russian government’s vision of national culture, history, and society,” the report said.Nathaniel Raymond, a Yale researcher, said the policy put Moscow in “clear violation” of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment of civilians during war and called the report a “gigantic Amber alert” — referring to US public notices of child abductions.The Russian activity since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine “in some cases may constitute a war crime and a crime against humanity,” he told reporters.The children included those with parents or obvious family guardians, those Russia deemed orphans, others who were in the care of Ukrainian state institutions before the invasion, and those whose custody was unclear or uncertain due to the war, the report said.Some of the children were adopted by Russian families or moved into foster care in Russia, the report said.Russia’s embassy in Washington, DC, responding to the reports, said Russia accepts children who were forced to flee Ukraine.“We do our best to keep underage people in families, and in cases of absence or death of parents and relatives — to transfer orphans under guardianship,” the embassy said on the Telegram messaging platform.Ukraine’s government recently said more than 14,700 children have been deported to Russia, with more than 1,000 of them from the port city of Mariupol, which was besieged for weeks and all but destroyed.Prosecutors have said they are examining allegations of forced deportation of children as part of efforts to build a genocide indictment against Russia.“This network stretches from one end of Russia to the other,” Raymond said.The system of camps and the adoption by Russian families of Ukrainian children taken from their homeland “appears to be authorized and coordinated at the highest levels of Russia’s government,” the report said, beginning with President Vladimir Putin and including Maria Lvova-Belova, the presidential commissioner for children’s rights.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price suggested that action could be taken against 12 individuals the report said are not yet subject to US sanctions.“We are always looking at individuals who may be responsible for war crimes, for atrocities inside of Ukraine,” he said.“Just because we have not sanctioned an individual to date says nothing about any future action that we may take.”The report said the children had also been given training in firearms, although Raymond said there was no evidence they were being sent back to fight.The Yale study was based on satellite imagery and publicly available accounts. The Humanitarian Research Lab is working as part of a State Department-backed project that has examined human rights violations and war crimes allegedly committed by Russia.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.06587,0.23887,4133,5,6,17,1,0
78,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/14/russia-prepares-air-fight-as-ukraine-ground-war-depletes-forces,"Russia may be planning to launch attacks on Ukraine with heavy air power to break a battlefield deadlock as NATO intelligence indicates Moscow is assembling fighter jets and helicopters near the border.The deployment of aircraft would mean it is crucial to get air-defence systems into Ukraine as fast as possible as Russia has intensified its offensive with the anniversary of its invasion upcoming, NATO officials said on Tuesday.US defence chief Lloyd Austin, speaking at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels where officials were meeting, noted Ukraine’s air defences at the moment were “not enough and we’re going to keep pushing until we get more because that threat is out there”.“We do know Russia has substantial aircraft … and a lot of capability left,” said Austin. “We want to make sure they have the ability to protect themselves in the event Russia decides to introduce its air force into the fight.”NATO intelligence reports say Russia is “amassing fixed-wing and rotary aircraft close to the border with Ukraine”, the Financial Times quoted two defence officials as saying.“The Russian land forces are pretty depleted so it’s the best indication that they will turn this into an air fight,” one told the Times. “If the Ukrainians are going to survive they need to have as many air defence capabilities and as much ammunition … as possible.”Asked whether Ukraine’s allies discussed the issue of sending fighter jets to help the country in its war effort, Austin said, “I don’t have any announcement to make today.”‘Crucial moment’Western defence chiefs met to discuss both new arms provisions to Kyiv and maintenance of existing supplies – including artillery shells whose production can hardly keep pace with the war.Ukraine renewed its appeal for fighter jets to help frustrate Moscow’s invasion as senior defence officials said the fight against Russia was approaching a critical stage.Defence minister Oleksii Reznikov, when asked what military aid his country is seeking now, showed reporters an image of a fighter jet.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed hard for combat planes last week when he visited London, Paris and Brussels on just his second foreign trip since Russia invaded on February 24, 2022. His plea came days after Western allies pledged to provide Kyiv with battle tanks.The possibility of sending combat aircraft to Ukraine was still being discussed. The United States has said no to sending Ukraine fighter jets but the United Kingdom is assessing the possibility and, on Tuesday, Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren said providing jets “has to be part of the consideration”.Ollongren said Kyiv had requested US-made F-16 jets from the Netherlands.“We have to debate this with our partners, also with the United States, and we have to think about feasibility,” she said. “It is something that will take time and it is best done behind closed doors.”Slovakia has said it is willing to discuss sending Soviet MIG-29 planes to help replace losses to Ukraine’s airforce.But German defence minister Boris Pistorius said procuring ammunition and air-defence systems is “much more important at the moment than the discussion about fighter jets”.Pistorius told reporters getting pilots up to speed on new aircraft and “training just to fly them takes several months, never mind teaching the abilities needed to deploy the weapons systems”.Offensives and counterattacksMeanwhile, the Kremlin said NATO was continuing to demonstrate hostility towards Russia and becoming more involved in the war in Ukraine.“NATO is an organisation which is hostile to us and which proves this hostility every day,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “It is trying its best to make its involvement in the conflict around Ukraine as clear as possible.”Moscow has said weapons supplies to Ukraine by NATO countries are dragging out the conflict and raising the possibility of further escalation.On the battlefield, the fighting continued to rage. Russia’s forces have pressed in the east of Ukraine while bolstering their defensive lines in the south. The war has been largely static during the winter months, though both sides are expected to increase attacks when the weather improves.Austin said he expected Ukraine to launch an offensive against Russia in the coming months.“Ukraine wants to create momentum … We expect to see them conduct an offensive sometime in the spring,” he told reporters.Russia is introducing a number of new troops to the battlefield but many are ill-trained and ill-equipped, Austin added.“Ukraine has urgent requirements to help it meet this crucial moment in the course of the war. The Kremlin is still betting it can wait us out but one year on we are as united as ever,” he said.The top US general, Mark Milley, took a shot at the leadership in Moscow saying it had already “lost”.“Russia is now a global pariah and the world remains inspired by Ukrainian bravery and resilience. In short, Russia has lost. They’ve lost strategically, operationally and tactically,” said Milley.",0.15243,0.45611,5047,16,6,14,0,1
79,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/14/ukraine-confronts-two-enemies-russia-and-corruption,"Almost one year into the Russia-Ukraine war, hundreds of thousands have died and nearly 17.6 million have been left in dire need of humanitarian assistance.While the Ukrainian government remained steadfast in the fight against Russia, Kyiv has also been confronting another enemy that has been gnawing within the country for years: corruption.During the last few weeks, Ukrainian authorities raided the home of the country’s former interior minister and sacked several senior government officials accused of bribery. Oleksii Reznikov, the country’s defence minister, is also set to be replaced after journalists and activists uncovered that the Ministry of Defence bought food for soldiers at vastly inflated prices.While the United States, European Union and NATO have pledged to continue assisting Ukraine, some politicians and military officials in the West have pointed to corruption in the country and questioned whether Ukraine was a good steward of the assistance it has received.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – hyper-aware of both the criticism from the West and the importance of keeping aid flowing – tackled corruption during an address in January. “I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past,” he said.“There is definitely a connection between the anti-corruption moves and Zelenskyy’s desire to keep Western military aid flowing,” Volodymyr Dubovyk, professor of international relations at Mechnikov National University in Odesa, Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.“Zelenskyy understood that he should address this issue quickly and resolutely without a delay, and he understands there are people in the US and the West who are calling Ukraine too corrupt,” Dubovyk said.“Ukraine’s worst fear is that the US and West will abandon them and that the flow of weapons will stop,” he added.Anti-Ukrainian sentiment in the West?In 2022, the US gave Ukraine $48bn in military, financial and humanitarian aid combined. Far-right Republicans in the US have increasingly questioned sending aid to the country.In January, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called Ukraine “one of the most corrupt countries in the world” in a tweet and questioned whether “American’s hard earned tax dollars are being stolen.”In November last year, Greene also introduced a resolution in US Congress calling for an audit of all aid sent to Ukraine.Donald Trump Jr, former US President Donald Trump’s eldest son, tweeted in December 2022: “Zelenskyy is basically an ungrateful international welfare queen.”It is clear Zelenskyy’s government has been closely following US politics.“There is worry about the Trump wing of the Republican Party taking power and then pulling support from Ukraine,” Dubovyk said.Jordan Gans-Morse, a professor of political science at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, agreed.“The Ukrainians are very savvy about the politics and culture of donor countries. They are definitely getting the message that there could come a turn in American politics that could threaten the support they are getting,” Gans-Morse said.Meanwhile, across the pond, the EU has remained unwavering in its commitment to support Ukraine, with the 27-member bloc having pledged approximately 67 billion euros ($72bn) for Ukraine and its civilians since the war began.Witold Waszczykowski, Polish politician and chair of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee at the European Parliament, told Al Jazeera that, right now, “other issues have a secondary meaning and the most important thing for Ukraine is to win the war with Russia”.“Here in Europe, it is our duty and obligation to help Ukraine to win the war. Equally important is to help Ukraine to survive the winter without electricity, heat, or water,” he said.However, fighting corruption is also a cornerstone for Ukraine to gain EU membership.In June 2022, the EU granted Ukraine the status of “candidate country” – an official move that would allow Kyiv to become a member of the EU. But before membership, candidate countries are required to undertake several political, economic and rule-of-law reforms to match EU standards.Lukas Andriukaitis, non-resident fellow at Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Al Jazeera that Kyiv’s current anti-corruption crackdown was on top of the agenda when it comes to discussing Ukraine’s future membership into the EU and was likely a political statement before the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place in Kyiv in early February.“As the EU talks are gaining speed together with financial support from the West, Ukraine needs to show that corruption will not be tolerated, even if the individuals are high-ranking officials in Ukraine,” he said.After the EU-Ukraine Summit in Kyiv, EU Council chief Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a joint statement acknowledging “the considerable efforts” Ukraine had undertaken to meet the objectives for EU membership, but did not signal that the accession process would be fast-tracked.Broader anti-corruption push within UkraineMoreover, while Ukraine’s anti-corruption campaign has grabbed the global limelight, for civilians in and from the country, the recent firing of corrupt officials displayed the progress of an anti-corruption movement that has been years in the making.According to Transparency International’s latest corruption perception index, in 2022 Ukraine ranked 116 out of 180 countries. The report noted that Ukraine has made significant improvements in tackling corruption during the last eight years.In 2014, after the deaths of hundreds of anti-corruption protesters, Ukraine’s parliament deposed pro-Russian Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovich in what came to be known as the Maidan Revolution or Revolution of Dignity.In the wake of the revolution, in an effort to meet the demands of civilians eager for Ukraine to become a member of the EU, the government set up a National Anti-Corruption Bureau, a High Anti-Corruption Court and other such agencies to prosecute corrupt officials, according to Oksana Nesterenko, lawyer and executive director of the Anti-corruption Research and Education Centre at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.“Ukraine has achieved significant progress in anti-corruption reforms. But the civil society is considered as a key actor in this process,” she told Al Jazeera.“Then, the war started in 2022 and we made the decision to hold back on our push until the situation improved.”“At this time, the government also realised how Russia was using corruption in Ukraine to display it as a failed state to the West. So the political will to fight corruption increased. The National Anti-Corruption Strategy was launched in 2022 and as anti-corruption experts, we got back to our pre-war task of fighting corruption,” she added.While tackling corruption was also one of Zelenskyy’s election campaign strategies during his 2019 campaign for president, he had minimal success at first, and his constituents noticed.On the eve of the war, his approval rating stood at 27 percent according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.But since the war began, Zelenskyy’s popularity has increased and now stands close to 84 percent.Today, the Ukrainian government looks like “a seriously responsible government doing what you would hope any government would do,” Gans-Morse said.“He [Zelenskyy] has more power to tackle corruption now than ever before,” he added.Sowing distrustAs Ukraine’s fight with corruption has intensified, its fight with Russia has continued to rage.Andriukaitis highlighted how pro-Kremlin social media users, bots and trolls have brought the war online after Ukraine’s recent anti-corruption actions, by surfacing videos of the arrest of corrupt Ukrainian officials to discredit Ukraine.“The idea is to sow distrust in Western societies about the support of Ukraine, to try and shake Western governments’ unwavering support with a bottom-up approach,” Andriukaitis said.Dubovyk believed Russian President Vladimir Putin is fearful of the anti-corruption push in Ukraine and sees it as potentially undermining his power at home.“Russians will be asking, ‘if Ukraine can do, why can’t we?’” Dubovyk said.“If Ukraine is successful in strengthening its democracy and moving away from Russia, it would be a major threat to Putin.”",0.03243,0.36097,8366,40,11,9,2,8
80,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/14/chinas-xi-conveys-support-for-iran-during-raisis-visit,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed support for Iran during a visit to China by President Ebrahim Raisi as Tehran tries to expand relations with Beijing and Moscow to offset Western sanctions over its nuclear development.“China supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty” and “resisting unilateralism and bullying,” Xi said in a statement carried by Chinese state TV on its website on Tuesday.His comments came as China hosted Raisi on his first state visit to the Asian economic giant and the first by an Iranian president in 20 years.Xi called for a proper resolution to the Iran nuclear issue as he expressed Beijing’s “solidarity” with Iran amid global uncertainty.China will continue to “participate constructively” in talks to resume negotiations on implementing the Iran nuclear agreement, Xi told Raisi in talks in Beijing.A 2015 nuclear agreement limited Iran’s uranium enrichment programme to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms in return for lifting international sanctions. Iran says it was further developing nuclear energy for peaceful reasons.But in 2018, then-United States President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned the deal, saying it had not done enough to curb Tehran’s nuclear activities, and reimposed sanctions.China has criticised Washington for withdrawing from the deal and insists the US should make the first move in reviving the pact.In September, the US imposed new sanctions on companies involved in Iran’s oil exports, including five based in China. Washington said it would continue enforcing sanctions on Iran’s oil and petrochemical sales so long as Tehran continues to accelerate its nuclear programme.Raisi was accompanied by a large Iranian trade and finance delegation in Beijing and was earlier greeted by Xi on a red carpet.“In the face of the current complex changes in the world, times, and history, China and Iran have supported each other [and] worked together in solidarity and cooperation,” Xi said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.Pressure over UkraineBoth countries face pressure from Western nations over their positions on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while Iran is already under strict US sanctions due to its nuclear programme.“China is Iran’s biggest trading partner and the only customer of its heavily-sanctioned oil exports,” said Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu. “US-led sanctions have left Iran in its toughest economic situation in more than 40 years.”Iran has emerged as one of Russia’s few remaining allies as Moscow has been pushed deeper into international isolation over the invasion.Western countries have accused Tehran of supplying armed drones to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine, a charge Iran denies.In December, Washington outlined what it said was an extensive relationship between Iran and Russia involving equipment such as helicopters, fighter jets and drones.Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine is a sensitive issue for Beijing, which has sought to position itself as neutral while offering diplomatic backing to its strategic ally Russia.“Xi Jinping says China will continue to take part in negotiations to get the agreement reinstated,” Yu said. “Ebrahim Raisi’s visit comes as both China and Iran strengthen their relationships with Russia. Both sides say they’re opposed to a world order led by the United States and its allies.”According to CCTV, the two sides signed a number of bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of agriculture, trade, tourism, environmental protection, health, disaster relief, culture and sport.Raisi and Xi had first met as presidents on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Uzbekistan in September. China had supported Iran’s now-successful bid to become a full member of the organisation.Last year, Iran and China also began the implementation phase of a 25-year cooperation accord under which China is to invest billions of dollars in Iran’s petroleum sector in exchange for the supply of oil and petrochemical products. China is already Iran’s biggest trading partner.The pact was originally proposed by Xi on his visit to Iran in 2016.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.0408,0.31882,4824,4,1,6,0,0
81,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/14/nato-chief-hints-finland-sweden-could-join-alliance-separately,"NATO’s secretary-general has said it is more important that Finland and Sweden join the military alliance quickly rather than at the same time amid tensions between the pair and Turkey, which has refused to ratify the Nordic nations’ membership bids.Speaking before a meeting of NATO defence ministers at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, Jens Stoltenberg said the “main question is not whether Finland and Sweden are ratified together”.“The main question is that they are both ratified as full members as soon as possible,” he told reporters.Stoltenberg’s comments marked the first open acknowledgment by NATO that the two countries may join the alliance separately after they abandoned decades of non-alignment and applied to join NATO in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.Their respective membership bids have been ratified by all 30 of the transatlantic alliance’s member states, except Hungary and Turkey, which is widely seen as the main hold-up to their joining.Unanimous approval is required for any country to become a new member.Turkish opposition to Sweden’s bidTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has indicated his country could ratify Finland’s application even while continuing to block Sweden’s.“Our position on Finland is positive, but it is not positive on Sweden,” he told Turkish parliamentarians at the beginning of February.Ankara has accused the government in Stockholm of being too lenient toward groups it deems to be “terrorist” organisations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups.Earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining NATO.Turkey is in an election year, and the topic of Nordic membership of NATO could be a vote winner. In recent weeks, Erdogan has expressed anger at a series of separate demonstrations in Sweden’s capital.In one such case in Stockholm, an anti-Islam activist burned a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected case, protesters hung an effigy of Erdogan.‘Our strong wish is still to join together’Western officials have said they would prefer both countries to join the NATO alliance together, partly because it would be easier to integrate them at the same time into its military structures.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has also said there are “obvious” reasons for his country and Finland to be approved as members hand in hand, such as the already close defence cooperation between the pair.Finland’s foreign minister said late last month that it was maintaining its plan to join NATO at the same time as Sweden despite Turkey’s opposition to the latter’s bid.“Our strong wish is still to join NATO together with Sweden,” Pekka Haavisto said.However, Finnish parliamentary groups said last week that they may ratify NATO’s founding treaties in the coming weeks, a step that could lead to Helsinki proceeding with membership ahead of Sweden.Of the two countries, only Finland shares a border with Russia. That said, some NATO allies, led by the United States, have offered security guarantees to both should they come under threat from any aggression by Moscow.Hungary has pushed back its ratification date for both countries three times so far, but has not publicly raised any substantial objections to either of them joining.",0.0619,0.38303,3361,1,1,2,0,0
82,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/14/russians-who-fled-war-win-case-to-end-stay-at-south-korea-airport,"A court in South Korea has granted two Russian men – who have been stranded at the country’s Incheon International Airport for months – the right to apply for refugee status and leave the terminal building.The Incheon District Court on Tuesday also rejected one other Russian national’s plea for asylum, without detailing the reasons for the decision.The three had landed at the airport in October after fleeing Russia to avoid being drafted to fight in Ukraine. South Korea’s justice ministry rejected their applications for refugee status, saying that avoiding military service did not qualify as a valid reason for receiving asylum in South Korea. All able-bodied men in South Korea must serve 18 months in the military as part of national service.The rejection left the men – whose lawyer requested they not be named out of concern for the safety of their families back in Russia – stranded for months in the airport’s transit area, prompting them to bring a case to court.“We welcome the court’s decision on the two but it is regrettable that it rejected the other one’s plea,” said Lee Jong-chan, a lawyer representing the three.“They came here trying to avoid killing innocent people and getting themselves killed in a war initiated by their home country. It took them four months just to win the right to apply for refugee status,” he said.Court orders #immigration office to screen #refugee requests of 2 #Russian men  https://t.co/GwAqaKbQ0B— The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) February 14, 2023The two will now be allowed to end their months-long airport stay and will be settled in South Korea while undergoing the asylum recognition process, which could take years.The third Russian has the right to appeal his rejection, but he must remain living at the airport in the interim. Another two Russians are also living at the airport. The court will rule on their cases for asylum later this month.Lee, the lawyer, told the Korea Times that returning to Russia was not a viable option for the third man.“There’s a low chance that he would choose to return to Russia where he would face harsh punishment,” Lee was quoted as saying.Travelling to another country might be an option, he added. Lee also said that he expected South Korea’s immigration authorities to appeal the court’s decision.“But even if they do, the two men who won the case will still be able to leave the airport in accordance with today’s court ruling,” he told the Korea Times.One of the asylum seekers – who arrived in South Korea on October 14 – told the newspaper that he could not believe the good news.“I have been so nervous and worried about the trials that I didn’t give much thought about what I should do when I leave the airport,” he wrote in a text message on Tuesday.Though South Korea has signed international conventions on refugees, the country typically accepts just a handful of asylum seekers each year.",0.11174,0.2718,2901,1,1,9,0,0

Asked Monday when he expects Russia’s so-called spring offensive to begin, Stoltenberg said “the reality is that we have seen the start already”.“For me, this just highlights the importance of timing. It’s urgent to provide Ukraine with more weapons,” he told reporters in Brussels.Stoltenberg said NATO sees “no sign whatsoever that [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin is preparing for peace”, and arming Ukraine more quickly could save lives by bringing a quicker end to the conflict.“It is clear that we are in a race of logistics. Key capabilities like ammunition, fuel, and spare parts must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the initiative on the battlefield. Speed will save lives,” he said.NATO members and Ukraine’s other allies are meeting at the alliance’s headquarters on Tuesday to drum up more weapons and ammunition for the war-torn country.On Wednesday they will discuss NATO’s defences on its eastern flank, close to Russia. Moves to beef up military budgets are also on the agenda.‘Chaotic shelling’The city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine came under heavy Russian artillery fire on Monday as Ukrainian forces there braced for possible ground attacks.Positions in Bakhmut have been fortified and only people with a military role were being allowed in, a deputy battalion commander said. Any civilians who still wanted to leave the city would have to brave the incoming fire.Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, is a major objective for Putin and months of Russian shelling have already left much of it in ruins.“The city, the city’s suburbs, the entire perimeter, and essentially the entire Bakhmut direction and Kostyantynivka are under crazy, chaotic shelling,” said Volodymyr Nazarenko, deputy commander of Ukraine’s Soboda battalion.“Every road is being shelled by artillery in a chaotic way.”‘Round-the-clock attacks’Nazarenko said that although no fighting was taking place in the city centre right now, the defenders were prepared to meet any assault. “The city is a fortress, every position and every street there, almost every building, is a fortress,” he said.The capture of Bakhmut would give Putin a new foothold in the Donetsk region and a rare victory after several months of setbacks. The Russian assault has been spearheaded by mercenaries of the Wagner Group, who have made small but steady gains.Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland. Russia partially occupies it and wants to win full control.”We are waiting for them to start massive round-the-clock attacks,” said Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said the main items on the agenda of the talks at NATO headquarters will be air defences, forming a tank coalition, training of troops and logistical support.As the new Russian offensive intensifies, Ukraine says it needs fighter jets and long-range missiles to counter this and to recapture lost territory.",0.08401,0.40085,3220,10,2,10,3,0
84,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/13/moldovan-president-warns-of-russian-interference,"Moldova’s president has accused Russia of planning to use foreign agents to infiltrate her government, use the tiny nation in the war against Ukraine and stop it from joining the European Union.Maia Sandu spoke on Monday after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that Kyiv had uncovered a Russian intelligence plot “for the destruction of Moldova”.Sandu, whose country borders Ukraine, has repeatedly expressed concern about Moscow’s intentions towards the former Soviet republic and about the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway Transnistria region.Sandu alleged Moscow’s plan involves citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering the country to initiate protests to “change the legitimate government to an illegal government controlled by the Russian Federation”.“The plan for the next period involves actions with the involvement of diversionists with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will undertake violent actions, attack some state buildings and even take hostages,” Sandu told reporters at a briefing.“The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power from Chisinau to an illegitimate one, which would put our country at the disposal of Russia in order to stop the European integration process,” Sandu said.“The Kremlin’s attempts to bring violence to Moldova will not work,” she added. “Our main goal is the security of citizens and the state. Our goal is peace and public order in the country.”Moscow angrily rejects accusationsRussia reacted angrily to Sandu’s remarks, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissing her allegations as “absolutely unfounded and unsubstantiated”.“They are built in the spirit of classical techniques that are often used by the United States, other Western countries and Ukraine,” Zakharova said on Tuesday.“First, accusations are made with reference to purportedly classified intelligence information that cannot be verified, and then they are used to justify their own illegal actions,” she added.Zakharova also accused Ukrainian authorities of having invented the purported plan by Moscow to destabilise Moldova to draw it into a confrontation with Russia.She argued Moldovan officials had meanwhile used “the myth about a Russian threat to distract Moldovan citizens’ attention from internal problems resulting from a disastrous social-economic course of the current administration and to step up the fight against dissent and political opponents”.Russia denied last year wanting to intervene in Moldova after authorities in Transnistria said they had been targeted by a series of attacks.Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilita, resigned last week [File: Octav Ganea/Inquam Photos via Reuters]‘Criminal elements’Since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago, Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners. In June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.Sandu said between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service intervened in “several cases of organised criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence”.Over the past year, Moldova has faced a string of problems. These include a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced its gas supplies, skyrocketing inflation, and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed its skies and debris found on its territory.Moldovan authorities confirmed another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.‘Order and discipline’Also last week, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned following the economic turmoil and the spillover effects of the war in Ukraine.Former Interior Minister Dorin Recean, a defence adviser to Sandu, will replace Gavrilita.“The new government will have three priorities: order and discipline, a new life and economy, and peace and stability,” Recean said.Tensions rose on Friday when Moldova said a Russian missile violated Moldovan airspace before hitting Ukraine. It summoned Russia’s ambassador to protest.The foreign ministry condemned “the latest unfriendly actions and statements against Moldova” and said they were “absolutely unacceptable”.Sandu said Moldova’s Parliament must adopt laws to equip its Intelligence and Security Service and the prosecutor’s office “with the necessary tools to combat more effectively the risks to the country’s security”.",-0.0118,0.33989,4482,8,4,13,0,1

88,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/11/wagner-mercenaries-boss-admits-russia-facing-bakhmut-resistance,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, has said that Russian forces must capture the strategic Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to proceed with their war campaign but that they were facing fierce resistance from Ukraine.In a rare interview made public Friday with a Russian military correspondent, Prigozhin said Russia had to establish clear goals in its nearly year-old war on Ukraine, namely to firmly establish its presence in eastern Ukraine or push forward to capture more of the country. The complete capture of Bakhmut was key to those plans, he said.“Bakhmut is needed so our troops can operate comfortably,” Prigozhin said.“Why is it called the meat grinder? Because the Ukrainian army is sending more and more and more units.”Wagner mercenaries, many conscripted from prisons in Russia, have played a large role in the war in Ukraine, particularly last month when they captured the town of Soledar, near Bakhmut – the city that has endured months of combat and bombardments and is known to both sides as the “meat grinder”.“It is probably too early to say that we are close,” the Wagner chief said of taking Bakhmut.“There are many roads out and fewer roads in. Ukrainian troops are well trained … and like any large city, it is impossible to capture it from head-on. We are managing very well,” he added.“First, we have to quietly take Artyomovsk and then we can say loud and clear that we have taken it,” he added, referring to Bakhmut by the Soviet-era name used by Moscow.The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said Wagner forces appeared to have advanced 2 to 3km (1 to 2 miles) around the north of Bakhmut since Tuesday – a rapid push in a battle where front lines have barely moved for months. It said Wagner fighters were now threatening the main western access road to Bakhmut although a Ukrainian military analyst said supplies were still getting through.The UK ministry also said Russian forces had made some advances near Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-held bastion that has been a linchpin between the southern and eastern fronts. But it added the limited Russian gains there had likely come at a high cost, including at least 30 armoured vehicles abandoned in one failed assault.Prigozhin also said the fighting to capture Soledar – undertaken after failures in taking Bakhmut – was comparable to the six months of battles needed for the Soviet army to secure Stalingrad during World War II. Prigozhin has harshly criticised the failings of the regular Russian army in its Ukraine offensive and engaged in a public dispute with Kremlin commanders when he maintained the battle for Soledar was exclusively waged by his Wagner forces after the regular army claimed the victory.In comments apparently aimed at Russia’s defence establishment, Prigozhin complained in January about “infighting, corruption, bureaucracy and officials who want to stay in their positions”, as well as what he called constant attempts to “steal victory” from Wagner.In January, the United States formally labelled the Wagner Group a “transnational criminal organization” and the European Union has accused Wagner forces of human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique.Military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the situation around Bakhmut probably remained the most difficult being faced by Ukraine’s forces as Russia deploys more and more conscripts to swarm the city.“The area south of Bakhmut is a very difficult sector,” Zhdanov said in an online interview.“And the city itself remains the hottest spot on the front at this time,” he said.",0.06749,0.37613,3642,7,6,10,0,0

But energy minister German Galushchenko said Russia had hit power facilities in six regions with missiles and drones, causing blackouts across most of Ukraine.Russia has repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat or water for days at a time in the middle of winter.The barrages have often followed Ukrainian diplomatic or battlefield advances.Friday’s attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended a tour of European allies, where he was enthusiastically received but secured no public promises of the fighter jets he was asking for.“London, Paris, Brussels – everywhere I spoke these past few days about how to strengthen our soldiers. There are very important understandings and we received good signals,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.“This concerns long-range missiles and tanks and the next level of our cooperation – fighter aircraft.”Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 10 Russian missiles had been shot down over the Ukrainian capital after sirens blared during the morning rush hour and weary civilians took shelter.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine was without 44 percent of nuclear generation and 75 percent of thermal power capacity.“This is a deliberate targeting of infrastructure that keeps Ukrainians alive in winter,” said US Department of State deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel.Russia has denied targeting civilians and said that the facilities it attacked supported Kyiv’s war effort.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, and Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz shake hands during a joint statement with French President Emmanuel Macron, centre, at the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris [Sarah Meyssonnier/Pool via AFP]Ukraine has been bracing for a new Russian offensive, believing that President Vladimir Putin wants to tout a battlefield success before the anniversary of the February 24 invasion. Ukrainian governors in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east said the that thrust had begun.Putin will give his delayed annual showcase address to parliament on February 21. That was the date last year when he recognised as independent the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk that were controlled by Russian-backed separatists, a prelude to invading.The complete capture of those provinces, among four that Russia subsequently claimed to have annexed, would let Putin assert that one of his main priorities had been achieved.Also before the invasion anniversary, US President Joe Biden will visit Poland, which neighbours Ukraine, from February 20 to 22 and speak about Ukraine as well as meet allies, the White House announced on Friday.Russian forces focus on DonbasRussian ground forces were focusing on Ukraine’s industrial east, especially the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the industrial Donbas region where recent fighting has been most intense, the Ukrainian military said. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces there since 2014.Kyiv has said Russian forces are pushing at key points on several fronts in the Donbas region, though Russian progress is reportedly slow.In the Donetsk region, local Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian military deployed additional troops and launched offensive operations.“There is a daily escalation and Russian attacks are becoming active throughout the region,” Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.In Luhansk province, the Russian army is trying to punch through Ukrainian defences, according to regional Governor Serhiy Haidai.“The situation is deteriorating, the enemy is constantly attacking; the Russians are bringing in a large amount of heavy equipment and aircraft,” Haidai said.There has been little change in battlefield positions for weeks amid freezing winter conditions.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed head of the Donetsk region, said that Russian forces had secured positions on the southern outskirts of Vuhledar.He added that Ukraine has sent additional reinforcements to the city that slowed the Russian advance.Pushilin’s claim could not be independently verified.Vuhledar is a strategically important town that sits next to a railway link crossing the region on the way to Crimea.Capturing the town is important for Russia to secure the safety of the railway connection to Crimea and advance its goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.06415,0.27234,5320,10,1,21,3,3

In the first days of the war, almost all experts assumed that Russia would be able to pursue its goals largely successfully.Al Jazeera: The war has had an immense toll on the Ukrainian people and the country is devastated. Fears of an escalation are high in Europe as the anniversary approaches. Has anything been learned over the past year, in terms of geopolitical developments?Ischinger: A development in this war that can only be seen as positive is the restoration of Western and European unity and cohesion. Just a few years ago, [then-United States President] Donald Trump sowed doubts about NATO, and [French President Emmanuel] Macron spoke of it being “brain dead”. Today, Sweden and Finland are waiting for their membership to become effective.Al Jazeera: Do you currently see a scenario in which the West and Berlin could send fighter jets to Ukraine?Ischinger: From my point of view, in this situation, nothing, absolutely nothing, should be ruled out as far as deliveries to Ukraine are concerned in order to leave the Russian side in the dark as much as possible.Al Jazeera: Ukraine says Russia is planning a new major offensive, that could begin within days. How do you see Ukraine’s chances and what role can the newly promised tanks play?Ischinger: The promised tank deliveries will not be able to play a role in the war in eastern Ukraine until late spring at the earliest. But regardless of the Leopard debate, Ukraine has been promised many critical additional military hardware in recent months.Examples are artillery, anti-aircraft and armoured personnel carriers, such as the Marder [German infantry fighting vehicle].Al Jazeera: Germany finally agreed to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine after facing significant pressure from Kyiv’s other Western allies. Its decision came around the same time as Washington’s move to supply Abrams. Is Europe’s desired strategic autonomy still out of reach?Ischinger: Yes, unfortunately.Al Jazeera: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hesitated for quite a while, fearing Russian retaliation, but this upset the Baltic States and some officials in Washington. Is Berlin’s reputation on the international stage irreversibly damaged?Ischinger: There is little irreversibility in foreign policy. If there have been disruptions, then they can and will be overcome again. In principle, the Transatlantic and German-American network of relationships is very good at the moment.Al Jazeera: Given Russia’s invasion, will Europe and Germany reconsider or even abandon the policy of “Wandel durch Handel” [change through trade] with aggressive nations?Ischinger: One should not think that “Wandel durch Handel” was seen as a motto that could reliably bring about political and social change. At the same time, it does not mean that intensified trade relations cannot produce stabilising political effects.One should not solely rely on this approach. Instead, one should also uphold the Harmel Doctrine: as much deterrence as necessary and as much cooperation, trade and dialogue as possible.Al Jazeera: Do you believe an end to the war in the foreseeable future is realistic, and what do you wish Ukraine and the Western alliance for 2023?Ischinger: I wish Ukraine and all of us a speedy end to this war. In foreign policy, however, one must always reckon with the “worst case” [scenario]. The worst case in this instant of the Ukraine war is a bloody conflict that drags on for years. Hopefully, we will be spared such an outcome.",0.02877,0.38645,4564,15,12,8,1,1

These missiles are a challenge to NATO and collective security. This is terror that can and must be stopped.”But in a foreign ministry statement, Romania said authorities had detected an “aerial target launched from the Black Sea from a ship of the Russian Federation” but “at no point did it intersect with Romania’s airspace.”“The closest the target trajectory got to Romania’s airspace was recorded by the radar at roughly 35km (22 miles) northeast of the border,” the statement continued.Two Romanian Air Force MiG-21 LanceR aircraft on air policing duty under NATO command were sent towards the north of Romania “to supplement our reaction options”, the statement added.The statement concluded by saying that the Romanian Air Force is permanently monitoring the national air space and the immediate surrounding area.Ukraine’s top general had earlier said two Kaliber missiles launched from the Black Sea had entered Moldovan airspace, then flew into Romanian airspace, before entering Ukraine.For its part, Moldovan officials confirmed detecting a missile that crossed their airspace, and summoned Moscow’s ambassador to indicate what they called an unacceptable violation.Moldova has already found Russian missile debris in its territory during the nearly year-long Russian invasion of Ukraine.Wave of attacks in UkraineMeanwhile, Russia unleashed a new wave of missile attacks on energy infrastructure across Ukraine on Friday, causing emergency power outages for millions of people and prompting new calls by Kyiv for Western arms.At least 17 missiles hit the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia in an hour in the heaviest attack since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, local officials said.Energy minister German Galushchenko said thermal and hydropower generation facilities and high-voltage infrastructure had been hit in six regions, forcing emergency electricity shutdowns across most of the country.“The most difficult situation is in Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Khmelnytskyi regions,” he said, referring to regions in the southeast, northeast and west of Ukraine.“Thanks to the successful work of the air defence forces and early technical measures, it was possible to preserve the integrity of the energy system of Ukraine. Energy workers are working non-stop to restore energy supply.”DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said four of its thermal power stations had been damaged and two energy workers injured. Water supplies were also hit in some areas, local officials said.After attacks on many parts of the country, officials said 13 missiles had been shot down over the southern region of Odesa, 10 missiles had been knocked out over the capital Kyiv and four in the Kryviy Rih area of central Ukraine.There was no immediate word of any deaths but Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said eight people had been wounded.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.04555,0.30926,4199,12,1,8,0,2
92,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/10/why-russia-lionises-inmates-fighting-in-ukraine,"The coffin with Sergey Molodtsov’s body was draped in a vermilion cloth and covered with a Russian flag. Four stern servicemen in parade uniforms carried it to his grave, and war veterans delivered speeches thanking him for “courage” and “heroism”.That’s how E1.ru, an online publication in the Urals Mountains region of Sverdlovsk, described in mid-January the funeral of the 46-year-old man who had been killed in Ukraine.It did not specify the date of Molodtsov’s death – but quoted an unnamed official talking fondly about him.“He was creative, dabbled in bone carving, worked at a jewellery workshop. Relatives remember Sergey as a wonderfully unordinary person who loved life. He was an honest person,” the official reportedly said.What he did not mention was that in 2017, Molodtsov was sentenced to 11-and-a-half years in jail for beating his mother to death – in a drunken stupor, with his hands and feet.He broke her jaw and skull, but claimed during the trial that she “fell,” according to the court papers quoted by E1.ru.‘Houses of the dead’Almost half a million inmates are serving time in Russian prisons, which are notorious for their cruelty dating back to Stalinist gulags and the Tsarist-era “houses of the dead” described by novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky.And tens of thousands of prisoners have been recruited to fight in Ukraine by the Wagner Group, a private military company, according to human rights groups, and Ukrainian and Western officials.They were promised hefty pay cheques and lavish compensation for their families if they die in combat.If they don’t – after six months of service – they were promised a presidential pardon and freedom.On January 20, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the pardons were “classified”.For some of the inmates-turned-mercenaries, honours seem to be part of the deal. On December 31, Russian President Vladimir Putin flew to the southwestern city of Rostov-on-Don to hand awards to dozens of servicemen who had fought in Ukraine.One of them was Aik Gasparyan, a full-bearded, khaki-clad 31-year-old who smiled awkwardly as Putin was handing him the For Courage medal.“I serve Russia and the Wagner private company,” Gasparyan said.He hardly expected this four years ago, when a Moscow court sentenced him to seven years and three months in jail for trying to rob a man in a cafe.Wagner made Garsparyan a poster boy whose rise to fame and freedom could convince more inmates to join the company.A day earlier, Gasparyan appeared in a video posted on Wagner’s Telegram channel.“There’s no f—g cheating, things are like they said – we’re fighting next to other [servicemen]. Now, we’re heading to Rostov to get awards,” he said.He also thanked Wagner’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin for “doing absolutely everything for us”.From a troll farm to ‘transnational’ crimePrigozhin is known as Putin’s “chef” because his catering companies serve the Kremlin and have won contracts to supply food to the military, schools and kindergartens.He also founded the Internet Research Factory, better known as a “troll farm”, that used social media networks to stifle criticism online and meddle in the 2016 presidential election in the United States, according to Washington.Prigozhin started Wagner in 2014 to back pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine, even though private military companies are still banned in Russia.Wagner started recruiting experienced fighters – and branched out to war-ravaged Syria to save President Bashar al-Assad’s government.However, until late 2022, Prigozhin preferred to stay in the shadows and sued Russian media outlets that reported about Wagner’s operations in Ukraine, Syria and Africa.Three Russian journalists who went to the Central African Republic in 2018 to film a documentary about Wagner’s role in the civil war and gold mining, were killed contract-style. Their relatives and colleagues claimed Prigozhin was behind their deaths, but Russian investigators said the reporters were killed during a robbery.The FAN, a Russian news agency connected to Prigozhin, claimed that French intelligence and former Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky allegedly “commissioned” the killings.In January, Washington designated the Wagner Group as a “transnational criminal organisation” that has 50,000 fighters in Ukraine. Eighty percent of them are inmates, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.‘Moral degradation’Wagner started recruiting them only last year, and Prigozhin personally visited dozens of prisons.“The motherland is in danger,” was the mantra he repeated, according to videos and inmates.Prigozhin was also fluent in prison slang – in the Soviet era, he served nine years for robbery.But some of its former officers have shunned recruitment.“If I were [inmate Gasparyan’s] commander, I’d say, ‘Take him away from me,” Marat Gabidullin, who served in Wagner for four years and led a reconnaissance unit in Syria, told Al Jazeera.“I don’t need a soldier like him,” said Gabidullin, who wrote a book about his experience and is seeking asylum in France.Analysts said recruiting convicts is useless from a military viewpoint – and only manifests the Kremlin’s moral degradation.“It speaks volumes about the [Kremlin’s] moral outlook in general,” Pavel Luzin, a defence analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.The practice cannot be implemented without an order from the Kremlin, he said.“There’s no advantage in using the inmates – by wasting people, the Kremlin is simply trying to win time. Nobody cares about reporting” their deaths, he said. “We’re dealing with deep moral degradation of Russia’s entire leadership”.The lionisation of inmates is “mental heritage” of the Russian empire and the USSR, when they were used to settle Siberia and fought on World War II front lines, said Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch.And the celebration of criminals-turned-war heroes serves as a litmus test of the unhealthy relationship between the Kremlin and average Russians.“It’s a mutation of their mental code towards a constant feeling of guilt before the state,” Kushch told Al Jazeera.The bogeymenWagner mercenaries are often referred to as “the orchestra” and “musicians”.“The orchestra awaits you,” read the billboards in the Urals Mountains city of Yekaterinburg in July that also listed a contact phone number and the group’s nascent website.The group has become a bogeyman for Kremlin critics.Liya Akhedzhakova, 84, a Russian actress whose film and theatre performances have become iconic, repeatedly said she was “ashamed” of Moscow’s warmongering and “tired of Russia’s pseudo-greatness”.In response, Andrey Medvedev, vice speaker of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, threatened her with Wagner.“If Akhedzhakova performs with ‘musicians’, the performance won’t be bad. Liya Medzhidovna, do you like Wagner?” he wrote on Telegram in late December. By early February, all of Akhedzhakova’s theatre performances were banned.A convicted murderer named Yevgeny Nuzhin joined Wagner in July.Two months later, he was captured near the southeastern city of Luhansk and told Ukrainian media that he had joined the company only to surrender. He described how Wagner’s officers used inmates as cannon fodder and “nullified,” or executed them for disobeying orders.The term gained popularity in Russia after Putin ordered a nationwide referendum to “nullify” his previous presidential terms.Even though Nuzhin said he wanted to fight against Russia, Kyiv swapped him for Ukrainian prisoners of war.On November 12, a video of his execution with a massive sledgehammer was released by the Grey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to Wagner.Two months later, Sergey Mironov, head of the pro-Kremlin “A Just Russia – For Truth” political party, received a similar sledgehammer from Prigozhin.Mironov tweeted he was “proud” of receiving the gift – and that his entire party supported the war.And he couldn’t miss a chance to threaten the war’s critics.“Kids, keep on tweeting, but remember – I got the hammer in my office,” he wrote.On Thursday, Prigozhin said Wagner stopped recruiting inmates. He did not specify the reason.",0.00962,0.32206,8173,6,13,19,4,0

He was in Brussels to attend a summit of the European Union.While Zelenskyy said that “Free Europe cannot be imagined without free Ukraine”, he heard from European Council chief Charles Michel that Ukraine’s road to EU membership would be long and hard.“Europe will be with us until our victory. I’ve heard it from a number of European leaders … about the readiness to give us the necessary weapons and support, including the aircraft,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in Brussels, without naming the countries.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said NATO must act together on jets for Ukraine.Presidents of Poland and Ukraine met in Rzeszow, southeast Poland, on Thursday and discussed the situation in the region, the office of the Polish president said on Friday on Twitter.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be Ukrainians who suffer if Britain or other Western countries supply fighter jets to Kyiv, and that the line between indirect and direct Western involvement in the war is disappearing.Moscow does not believe Kyiv’s pledges that it will not use long-range Western arms to strike deep into Russian territory, Alexei Polishyuk, a department head at Russia’s foreign ministry, told state-owned RIA news agency.Nord Stream pipelinesRussia’s foreign ministry said European countries were trying to hide the results of their investigations into last year’s explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, accusing them of covering up who was to blame.Economy/SocietyPresident Vladimir Putin said Russia’s economy had overcome the worst effects of sanctions and was expected to show modest growth this year, despite what he said were attempts to undermine certain industries.A quarter of Ukraine’s population is at risk of developing a severe mental health condition as the country grapples with the year-long Russian invasion, a senior health official said.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.0108,0.27086,3993,9,2,12,1,3

Draghi travelled with Macron and Scholz to Kyiv by train last June and played a leading role with them in shaping EU opposition to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Meloni has pledged to maintain the same pro-Ukraine stance, despite the misgivings of some of her coalition allies, telling reporters on Thursday that providing help to Kyiv was the best way to bring about peace.Underscoring her willingness to support Kyiv, Italy and France finalised technical talks last week for the joint delivery of a SAMP/T-MAMBA air defence system to Ukraine early this year.However, Meloni’s brand of nationalist politics has put her at odds with both Macron and Scholz on an array of other issues and the close ties that Draghi forged with Paris and Berlin seem a distant memory.Paris last November accused Meloni’s new government of breaking a bond of trust and breaching international laws by refusing to take in refugees and migrants saved by a charity rescue ship. The boat eventually docked in France instead.Earlier this week, French and German ministers flew to Washington together to discuss contested US subsidies with their US counterparts, excluding Italy, which is the second-largest manufacturer in the European Union after Germany.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.03143,0.15959,3461,7,0,2,0,4

I’ve heard it from a number of European leaders … about the readiness to give us the necessary weapons and support, including the aircraft,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.“I have a number of bilaterals now; we are going to raise the issue of the fighter jets and other aircraft,” he said.Ukraine’s leader gave no further details about the pledges, which would mark one of the biggest shifts yet in Western support for Ukraine if confirmed.There was no immediate confirmation from any European countries of the alleged promises.Zelenskyy had earlier received rapturous applause and cheers from the European Parliament and met a summit of the European Union’s 27 leaders, insisting in a showpiece address that his country’s fight with Russia was one for the freedom of all of Europe.Kremlin warns West against supplying jetsTo date, Ukraine’s Western backers have refused to send fighter jets to Kyiv amid fears of potentially escalating the war or becoming further embroiled themselves in the conflict.Moscow has repeatedly warned it will retaliate against any such moves.But the mood appeared to have begun to shift during Zelenskyy’s European tour, which began on Wednesday with trips to London and Paris.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged during the Ukrainian president’s visit that the United Kingdom would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on modern NATO combat aircraft.A spokesman for Sunak’s government also said it was weighing whether to send Ukraine fighter jets in the “long-term”.There were no such commitments from France and Germany later on Wednesday, but Paris is reported to be among a number of European capitals that is open to the prospect of sending jets to Ukraine as part of a collective Western decision.The developments drew a furious response from Russia, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warning it would be Ukrainians who suffered if the UK or other Western countries supplied combat aircraft to Kyiv.“The line between indirect and direct involvement is gradually disappearing. One can only express regret in this regard, and say that such actions … lead to an escalation of tension, prolong the conflict and make the conflict more and more painful for Ukraine,” Peskov said on Thursday.Russian forces advanceSeparately on Thursday, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said there would be no immediate transfer of UK fighter jets to Ukraine.“Britain hasn’t said it is necessarily going to send fighter jets to Ukraine,” Wallace said while on a visit to Rome.He told the BBC it was “more realistic and more productive” for the UK to seek to provide Ukraine with aircraft in the long term to ensure its security after the war with Russia had concluded.Russian forces have been advancing in Ukraine’s east in recent weeks for the first time in half a year, fortified with tens of thousands of freshly mobilised recruits, in relentless winter battles that both sides describe as some of the bloodiest of the war.Kyiv says it expects Moscow to broaden its offensive as the invasion’s February 24 anniversary approaches.Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” designed to “demilitarise and denazify” the country.Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected all of Moscow’s rationales for its offensive, arguing it acted without provocation to wage a war of aggression aimed at seizing land and subjugating Ukraine.",0.06028,0.35124,3660,12,7,6,0,4

So I also condemn the provocateurs in the strongest possible terms,” Waters told diplomats in New York City via video link, without referring to any specific individuals, groups or countries.“The only sensible course of action today is to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine,” he added.Waters’s comments drew a sharp rebuke from Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, who accused the musician of attempting to “whitewash” Moscow’s actions.“In 1979, Pink Floyd came up with a song, Another Brick in the Wall. The same year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and after the invasion was condemned by Pink Floyd” Kyslytsya said.“It is ironic, if not hypercritical, that Mr. Walters attempts now to whitewash another invasion. How sad for his former fans to see him accepting the role of just a brick in the wall. The wall of Russian disinformation and propaganda.”The United States, which is Ukraine’s most prominent backer in the West, also denounced Waters.“We’ve been brought together today once again to hear another version of why Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine is actually the fault of Ukraine or Ukraine’s partners. Or, in Mr Waters words, Ukraine friends who are provocateurs,” Richard Mills, the US deputy ambassador to the UN, told the 15-member Security Council.“We unequivocally reject the victim-blaming notion that Ukraine’s self-defence is the obstacle to ending this war. No one wants peace in Ukraine more than Ukrainians themselves. It is Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity that has been violated, not Russia’s,” he said.In September last year, Waters argued against the Western supply of weapons and accused Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of allowing “extreme nationalism” to flourish.In an open letter to Zelenskyy’s wife Olena Zelenska, Waters wrote: “Sadly, your old man agreed to those totalitarian, anti-democratic dismissals of the will of the Ukrainian people, and the forces of extreme nationalism that had lurked, malevolent, in the shadows, have, since then, ruled the Ukraine.”“They have, also since then, crossed any number of red lines that had been set out quite clearly over a number of years by your neighbours the Russian Federation and in consequence they, the extreme nationalists, have set your country on the path to this disastrous war,” he added.Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” designed to “demilitarise and de-Nazify” the country.Kyiv and its Western allies reject Moscow’s rationales, arguing that Russia is waging a war of aggression aimed at seizing land and subjugating Ukraine.",-0.05727,0.43763,3166,17,3,10,1,2

A series of offensives followed, in which Russian military reporters claimed their country’s forces had pushed as far as Yampolivka, 16km (10 miles) west of Kreminna.Fierce fighting continued to rage through the week in Bakhmut, a town at the centre of the eastern front which Russian forces have been trying to capture since last summer.A Ukrainian commander told a Western reporter its defenders could hold out for “one or two more months”.Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a research organisation, wrote that the situation around Bakhmut “increasingly looks precarious for the Ukrainian Army, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they ultimately withdraw from the city”.“I’ve often had to say the situation at the front is tough and is getting tougher, and it’s that time again,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on February 4 in a nightly video address.But the fiercest fighting took place at the southern end of the front, where Russian forces reportedly committed six battalion tactical groups to Vuhledar, a coal-mining town in the Donetsk region, throwing Ukrainian fighters onto the defensive.A three-day battle for Vuhledar culminated on February 6, when Ukraine’s military reported it had killed more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in a day, and destroyed 14 tanks and 28 armoured personnel carriers – an extraordinary toll. According to a Ukrainian reserves officer, some 30 of those vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the Vuhledar area.Russia also claimed heavy Ukrainian losses.Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the tolls.Video from the area showed Ukrainian forces destroying two Russian T-90 tanks. These are Russia’s latest and best, equipped with sensors alerting tank crews when they are targeted.More tanks, fasterSensing the urgency of the situation, Ukraine’s allies, which had held back promises of battle tanks until late January, were feverishly preparing the vehicles for combat and pledging more.The first of four Canadian Leopard 2A4 tanks have arrived in Poland.Germany, which had delayed announcing its first batch of 14 Leopard 2A4 tanks, additionally pledged 100 Leopard 1A5 tanks, bringing the total tanks allies have promised this year to 223.Pledges from Portugal, Norway and Spain to deliver about two dozen tanks were understood to be pending, while Germany may yet provide more. Other Baltic and North Seas countries were said to be pondering pledges. Ukraine has requested at least 300 tanks to liberate its territories.Ukraine also received other reinforcements.US President Joe Biden announced a $2.2bn military aid package, including artillery rockets, howitzer and mortar shells, Javelin anti-tank systems, air defences, heavy machineguns and mine-resistant vehicles.Norway pledged $730m in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine over five years, spending some of its windfall oil and gas profits occasioned by the war.Ukraine was even reported to be importing mortar bombs from Azerbaijan in an ever-widening effort to obtain the ammunition it needs.Switzerland’s parliament is reviewing the country’s tradition of neutrality, which goes back to the Napoleonic Wars. An arms manufacturer, Switzerland has been under increasing pressure from Western allies to allow its weapons to be given to Ukraine.“We shouldn’t have the veto to stop others [from] helping Ukraine. If we do that, we support Russia, which is not a neutral position,” FDP party leader Thierry Burkert told the Reuters news service.During a rare trip abroad on February 8, Zelenskyy told a full session of the British Parliament why not only tanks but fighter jets would be of paramount importance for Ukraine’s defence in the coming months.“In Britain, the king is an air force pilot, and in Ukraine, every air force pilot is a king,” he said. “I will be leaving Parliament today thanking all of you in advance for powerful English planes.”Time is of the essenceUkraine is not expected to field any of the new tanks until late March.Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov believes that will leave Ukraine to face a new Russian onslaught with what it has got for at least a month.“Given that Russians live in symbolism, they will try something around February 24,” he said.Others believe the incursion will come sooner – mid-February, says the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai.“We are seeing more and more [Russian] reserves being deployed in our direction, we are seeing more equipment being brought in … They bring ammunition that is used differently than before – it is not round-the-clock shelling any more. They are slowly starting to save, getting ready for a full-scale offensive,” Haidai told Ukrainian television.Zelenskyy believes the offensive is already under way. “I think it has started,” he said on January 30.He may be right.Russia’s only mobile service provider in Luhansk shut down its mobile internet service on Moscow’s orders on February 2.“In this way, the enemy wants to ensure the secrecy of their movement during military operations, because the Russians know that their every step is tracked by the locals and transmitted to the armed forces,” the Ukrainian resistance centre said.Can Ukraine hold out?Reznikov told BMFTV that Russia had mobilised half a million new troops, not 300,000, as stated by the Russian defence ministry.Russia “can attempt a two-axis offensive: it can be Donbas and it can be the south”, Reznikov said.“The Ukrainians will be assessing Russian capacity to undertake these attacks,” said Major-General Mick Ryan in War Shorts, a podcast.Expressing a consensus among military experts, he believed Russia could not sustain a new offensive.“The Russians have lost a huge number of soldiers and contractors in the last couple of months, in particular junior and mid-ranking leaders. So even the injection of one or two hundred thousand mobilised troops isn’t going to rebuild the Russian army. Indeed it’s going to make their challenge more compelling, because commanding 150 junior soldiers that don’t have a lot of training is a pretty big ask for the remaining leaders who remain in the Russian army in Ukraine,” said Ryan.Kofman believed Russia’s “force quality appears relatively low” and “can likely offer a stubborn defence, but [is] less liable to be suitable for offensive operations”.Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was “almost certainly” trying to capture the remaining Donbas, but was unlikely to succeed with “undermanned, inexperienced units” because “Russia, too, now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives”.But some military experts say the real problem is Western unease over arming the Ukrainians to win.“If the fighting drags on through the spring and summer and Ukraine inflicts enormous casualties on Russia while liberating substantial territory, it will become increasingly difficult for Zelensky to grant Putin a face-saving exit from the war and permit Russia’s continued but temporary occupation of Crimea,” wrote Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a retired US Army officer.“Washington should give Ukraine the weapons and assistance it needs to win quickly and decisively in all occupied territories north of Crimea — and to credibly threaten to take the peninsula militarily,” Vindman said.",0.06171,0.37454,8500,18,5,31,1,4
99,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/9/ukraine-war-tests-spanish-unity,"Madrid, Spain – Like many in Spain, Begoña Castro is in favour of helping Ukraine to fight back against the invading Russian army.In fact, she believes the Spanish government is not doing enough to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from overrunning Kyiv.“We have been following the NATO line and giving arms, but it seems that the coalition government is split and do not want to give too much help to Ukraine,” the 43-year-old financial analyst told Al Jazeera from her home in Seville, southern Spain.“The defence minister said the other day that Spain would send defensive weapons. Defensive weapons!? We are either sending weapons or not. I support Ukraine and I just don’t think we are doing enough. We should send more arms.”Castro, who describes herself as politically “right wing”, says she feels Spain, like many other European countries, has a duty to help Ukraine in its time of need as the first anniversary of the start of the war nears on February 24.It is an opinion held by most Spaniards, according to a series of polls.Spain’s left-wing coalition government, however, is divided on its response.The ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party support the NATO policy of sending arms to support Ukraine and pledged earlier this month to send five Leopard tanks to Kyiv.As part of the European Union, Madrid has also sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs whose yachts have been moored in superyacht marinas along the Mediterranean.José Manuel Albares, the Spanish foreign minister, recently defended the decision to send tanks, saying it would not escalate the war with Russia.“Unfortunately, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin does not need any excuse to escalate [the war]. They [the Russians] will do what they want. We all want peace but there is a person, [Putin], who doesn’t want it,” Albares told Telesur television channel in an interview.But the far-left Unidas Podemos, the coalition’s junior partner whose votes prop up the minority government, has adopted a different approach.The party, which started from street protests in 2014, has backed sending humanitarian aid but opposes increasing arms shipments.Officially, when the coalition government was formed in 2019, Podemos agreed that the Socialists would take the lead in foreign policy, and it would not interfere.However, tensions emerged in the Spanish government after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Leading figures in Podemos have voiced opinions in public which contradict the Socialists’ policy.“Podemos opposes the NATO war rage and (we) refuse to escalate the war in Ukraine with more and more weapons to encourage the warlords even if (public opinion) crushes us on television,” Pablo Echenique, the parliamentary spokesperson for Podemos said last week in reference to NATO’s decision to send more Leopard tanks.Public support for military aidMore than 157,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Spain since last year, according to official data from December. Of these, 64 percent are women, and 36 percent are under 20.But Spain is not just providing shelter to refugees fleeing Russian bombs.Last month, 225 Ukrainian troops and civilians began training at a military base in Toledo, south of Madrid, under an EU scheme.A poll in January for the Centre for Sociological Investigations (CIS), a government body, found that 23.4 percent of Spaniards were “very worried” about Ukraine, while 49.2 percent said they were “worried” and 12.9 percent were concerned about the war. In contrast, 13.8 percent said they were not concerned.A similar poll in March last year by CIS found seven out of 10 backed NATO sending military arms to support Ukraine.Putin’s military aggression in Ukraine was among the biggest worries for Spanish teenagers, according to a study of adolescents by the University of Seville for UNICEF Spain which was published in February this year.It found the Ukraine war concerned 12.8 percent of teenagers, making it the second biggest worry after the effects of the pandemic, which concerned 14.6 percent of those questioned.“We want to listen more to our boys, girls and adolescents because they have got a lot to say,” said José María Vera, executive director of UNICEF Spain.‘Spain should be neutral’However, not everyone is in favour of sending aid or tanks to help Ukraine.Some on the far right and the hard left have opposed supporting Kyiv because they are sympathetic towards Moscow, or they believe that the NATO policy does not help Spain’s interests.“It is a waste of time. Spain should be neutral like Hungary or Austria. Spain was neutral in the first and second world war and this was much better for our national interests,” Guillermo Rocafort, a lawyer, told Al Jazeera.“Following America blindly like this does not help our country at a time when our economy needs to concentrate on recovering from the pandemic.”He believes that arms sent by the West have been used to “attack civilians in pro-Russian areas” in Ukraine.Lluis Orriols, a professor of politics at the University Carlos III in Madrid, said the differences within the coalition were “evident”.“But it must be said that there was an agreement by both parties when they formed a coalition that the Socialists would lead on foreign policy and Podemos would not interfere. So, these differences of opinion have less consequences,” he told Al Jazeera.“The position of Podemos is typical of the Spanish left which means it is against the Atlantic pact and NATO and not to be allied with the United States. But Podemos are not against helping Ukraine. They are more in favour of humanitarian aid. They have a more pacifist attitude towards the war.”But what of the Ukrainians who have started a new life in Spain?Anastasiia, who did not want to give her surname, travelled from Kyiv to stay with about 40 other women and children to stay at a shelter near Valencia in April last year.She was grateful to the Spanish for the reception she had received.“For us, it has been hard to start a new life here. We miss our families and our country of course so much. But the Spanish have been so friendly and welcoming it has not been so difficult,” she told Al Jazeera through an interpreter.",0.05941,0.26663,6179,14,12,9,4,0

Moscow’s forces concentrated on the areas of Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut and Avdiivka, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said on Facebook.Kyiv says it expects Moscow to broaden that offensive with a big push as the February 24 anniversary of the invasion approaches.RussiaInternational prosecutors said they have found “strong indications” that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the use in Ukraine of a Russian missile system that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine in 2014. The Kremlin, which has repeatedly denied any Russian state involvement in downing the plane, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russian authorities are discussing a one-off budget contribution from businesses this year of about 200-250 billion roubles ($2.8-$3.5bn), three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters, as Moscow seeks to rein in its widening budget deficit.Western sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced state oil revenues and diverted tens of billions of dollars towards shipping and refining firms, some with Russian connections.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.08961,0.26201,3228,4,3,9,1,2

He also addressed the diplomatic tensions that ensued after an alleged Chinese surveillance balloon was spotted over the United States last week.“Last week, Beijing violated international law and US sovereignty with the presence of a Chinese surveillance balloon in US airspace,” Blinken told reporters on Wednesday at a news conference with Stoltenberg.China, meanwhile, has said the balloon was a “civilian” craft collecting weather data and that it was blown off course.Blinken said the US would share findings about the balloon, which was shot down off the east coast of the US over the weekend, with US Congress and allies around the world. He added that efforts by the US Navy were ongoing to recover the balloon fragments.“We’re analysing them to learn more about the [Chinese] surveillance program,” he said, adding that China presented “systemic and tactical challenges” to the NATO alliance.The meeting comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches. Western governments have responded to the conflict with a significant influx of military assistance for Ukraine and efforts to isolate Russia on the world stage.“Putin launched his illegal war of aggression almost a year ago,” said Stoltenberg. “Since then, NATO allies have provided unprecedented support for Ukraine. Around $120bn in military, humanitarian and financial assistance.”Blinken said the US has sent Ukraine nearly $30bn in military aid since the conflict began last February, not including humanitarian and economic aid.Russia’s invasion has prompted several European nations, including Sweden and Finland, to push for membership in NATO, a mutual defence alliance that traces its origins to the Cold War.Blinken told reporters the US was “very focused” on bringing Sweden and Finland into NATO, calling the two countries “strong democracies” and “trusted partners”.Those efforts have run into objections from NATO members Turkey and Hungary. Unanimous approval is required among the alliance’s 30 members to secure membership for new countries.Russia has long been critical of NATO expansion. Its defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, also warned earlier this week that Western shipments of military hardware to Ukraine risked spurring an “unpredictable” escalation, “dragging NATO countries into the conflict”.At Wednesday’s news conference, Stoltenberg said NATO members should continue to boost their military spending, citing the challenges of a “more dangerous and more competitive world”.In December 2022, the US Congress passed a spending package that increased US military spending, already the highest in the world, by an additional 10 percent, bringing the total to an enormous $858bn.",0.02982,0.35126,2883,6,4,4,1,0
102,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/us-has-questions-to-answer-over-nord-stream-blasts-russia-says,"The United States has questions to answer over its alleged role in explosions that destroyed the undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, Russia’s foreign ministry says.It was commenting on a blog post published earlier on Wednesday by respected American journalist Seymour Hersh that accused the US military of involvement in the blasts and alleged President Joe Biden green-lighted the operation.Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called on the White House to address the “facts” presented by Hersh.Quoting one unnamed source with “direct knowledge of the operational planning”, Hersh detailed how “skilled deep-water divers” from the US Navy planted C-4 explosives during a training exercise last June, then detonated the payload remotely three months later.“President Joseph Biden saw the pipelines as a vehicle for [Russian President] Vladimir Putin to weaponise natural gas for his political and territorial ambitions,” Hersh wrote.Hersh is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who exposed the 1969 massacre of Vietnamese civilians by American forces. He also broke the story of US troops brutalising Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib after the US invasion in 2003.Russia, without providing evidence, has repeatedly said NATO nations were behind last September’s explosions affecting the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines – multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects that carried Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Western officials have denied those accusations.“The White House must now comment on all these facts,” Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page, where she summarised Hersh’s main claims regarding the alleged US involvement.The White House on Wednesday dismissed Hersh’s post. “This is utterly false and complete fiction,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. A US Department of State spokesperson said the same.A Central Intelligence Agency spokesperson echoed the White House denial, calling the report “completely and utterly false”.‘Something to hide’The US and NATO have called the Nord Stream explosions “an act of sabotage“.Investigators from Sweden and Denmark – in whose exclusive economic zones the blasts occurred – have said the ruptures were a result of sabotage, but have not said who they believe was responsible.Moscow said the countries “have something to hide” and are purposefully blocking Russia from the investigation. Its defence ministry previously accused British navy personnel of blowing up the Nord Steam pipelines.Construction of Nord Stream 2, designed to double the amount of gas Russia could send directly to Germany under the sea, was completed in September 2021. But the pipeline was never put into operation after Berlin shelved certification just days before Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in February 2022.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Hersh’s blog post deserved more attention and he was surprised it had not been covered more fully by Western media.“The world must find out the truth about who carried out this act of sabotage,” Peskov told reporters. “This is a very dangerous precedent: if someone did it once, they can do it again anywhere in the world.”He called for “an open international investigation of this unprecedented attack on international critical infrastructure”, adding: “It is impossible to leave this without uncovering those responsible and punishing them.”Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko was later quoted by TASS news agency as saying Russia could take political or legal action.“The investigation is being carried out in such a way that … the remains are literally and figuratively left in the water,” he said.",0.00488,0.27061,3708,1,0,8,1,0

Give us wings to protect it.”“I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet the most important words – combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”The UK’s King Charles III meets Zelenskyy at Buckingham Palace [Aaron Chown/pool via Reuters]At a joint news conference with Zelenskyy later in the day, Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to supplying Ukraine with jets to fight Russia.“The first step in being able to provide advanced aircrafts is to have soldiers or aviators that are capable of using them. That is a process that takes some time. We’ve started that process today,” Sunak said.Russia’s embassy to the UK warned London against sending fighter jets to Ukraine, saying such a move would have ramifications for the entire world, Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency reported.The UK announced plans to expand a programme training Ukraine’s military to ensure its pilots could fly sophisticated jets of NATO military alliance’s standard.The announcement gave no timeframe and stopped short of a commitment to provide Kyiv with British jets. But it signalled a shift that could pave the way for other nations to send planes.Zelenskyy also met King Charles at Buckingham Palace.“We’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long, I can’t tell you,” the king said.Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from London, said Zelenskyy’s visit is “perhaps a recognition, an acknowledgement of Britain’s steadfast support for Ukraine”.“[This is] doubtless an opportunity for President Zelenskyy, not just a wartime leader but an absolutely relentless campaigner for international support for Ukraine,” Hull said.Zelenskyy’s tour of Europe, which will also include a European Union summit in Brussels, follows a surprise trip to the United States in December. The choreography of meeting the British, French and German leaders the same day was a sign of his assiduous care in cultivating Western opinion.Germany’s Scholz said he expected strong support for Ukraine from this week’s EU summit and a new round of European sanctions on Russia around the anniversary of the invasion.Scholz, publicly more cautious than some other Western leaders on arms deliveries, said decisions on weapons were best coordinated behind the scenes rather than announced by countries in a “public competition to outdo each other”.His defence minister said Western allies could deliver a first battalion of about 31 Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine in the early months of this year.Nataliya cries at the grave of her brother Oleg Kunynets, a Ukrainian soldier who was killed in the east of the country [Emilio Morenatti/AP]Western countries have scaled up pledges of aid, including the offer last month of tanks.

In fact, such steps are dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of escalation.”His allusion to “our territories” appeared to be a reference to four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – that Russia claims to have annexed following referendums last September that were condemned by Kyiv and its Western allies as illegitimate.Much of the territory in the Russian-claimed regions is currently in Ukrainian hands.Moscow has repeatedly accused the NATO alliance of playing a direct role in the war by supplying arms to Kyiv.Ukraine says the weapons are urgently needed to stave off Russian attacks and boost its firepower for a spring offensive against Moscow’s forces. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is accumulating arms and reserves for a renewed assault in the coming weeks.UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed concern about the war’s recent direction. Peace prospects “keep diminishing” and “the chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing”, he said in a speech late Monday.“I fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war – I fear it is doing so with its eyes wide open.”Longer-range rocketsThe United States has sent more than $20bn worth of military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last February, and is set to provide Kyiv with longer-range rockets as part of a new $2bn package of weapons announced last week.Since the beginning of the year, Western countries have pledged hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles to Ukraine to give it the firepower and mobility to push through Russian lines and recapture occupied territory later this year.The new US package of weapons was expected to include longer-range rockets, which would give Ukraine the ability to hit Russian supply lines in all of the territory it occupied in Ukraine’s mainland and parts of the Crimea Peninsula.But it will take months for the new arms to arrive. Meanwhile, Ukraine faces a Russian force with its manpower replenished by Moscow’s call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists.Russia continues to throw waves of troops at cities and towns in the eastern Donbas region.Fighting has focused for months around the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut in eastern Donetsk province, which Russia has been trying to encircle.Moscow has also launched an assault further south against Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-held bastion at the strategic intersection between the eastern and southern front lines.“Military operations are at the moment progressing with success in the areas around Vuhledar and Artemovsk,” said Shoigu, using the previous name for the besieged town of Bakhmut.Shoigu listed seven settlements that Russia has recently “liberated”, including the salt-mining town of Soledar that came under Russian control in January.‘Undermanned, inexperienced units’Some military analysts have been sceptical, however, about Russia’s ability to mount a large new offensive in the coming weeks. Ukraine and Russia are both still training their new troops and amassing weapons.The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said in an assessment on Tuesday that Russia is “requiring undermanned, inexperienced units to achieve unrealistic objectives due to political and professional pressure”.“Russian leaders will likely continue to demand sweeping advances,” it added. “It remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks.”Michael Kofman, an American military analyst and director of Russia studies at the CAN, a research organisation in Arlington, Virginia, tweeted on Monday that it was unclear how big an offensive Russia would be able to mount.He added, “but I suspect it may prove underwhelming, focused largely on the Donbas”.",-0.00024,0.31328,4248,10,4,19,0,0

The Ukrainian claim that it was the highest number of Russians killed in one day could not be independently verified.Russia has also claimed to have killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks. It said it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January.The assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare, which has left the snow-covered battlefields of eastern Ukraine littered with bodies.Close to the town of Maryinka, 30km (18.6 miles) west of the eastern city of Donetsk, a marine unit of Ukraine’s armed forces fired rockets on Russian positions with a Soviet-era launch system.“They storm in small infantry groups, trying to creep in farther and farther,” a soldier who gave his name only as Ievhen told the Reuters news agency. “Even without the previous artillery strikes [on Ukrainian positions], their infantry attempts to move in.”“The enemy adapted quite well,” he said. “They learn as fast as we do. They have adopted different kinds of tactics.”Kyiv and the West say Russia has been pouring troops and mercenaries into eastern Ukraine in recent weeks in hopes of being able to claim new gains around this month’s first anniversary of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Ukrainian servicemen ride in a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launch system as they prepare to fire it towards Russian positions on the front line near the eastern town of Maryinka [Marko Djurica/Reuters]A lieutenant in the Ukrainian unit who gave his name as Volodymyr said: “The targets are given to us either by drone operators or by our spotters. They observe where our rockets explode. Then we correct our fire direction and launch again.”The war will soon enter its second year at a pivotal juncture as Moscow tries to regain the initiative while Kyiv holds out for Western tanks to mount a counteroffensive later in 2023.After Russia failed to capture the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, last year and lost ground in the second half of 2022, Moscow is now making full use of hundreds of thousands of soldiers it called up in its first mobilisation since World War II.The past few weeks have seen Russia boast of its first gains for months. But the progress has been incremental, and Moscow has yet to capture a single major population centre in its winter campaign despite thousands of dead.Fighting has focused for months around Ukrainian-held Bakhmut in Donetsk province, a city with a pre-war population of about 75,000. Russia has made clear progress towards encircling it from both the north and south, but Kyiv said its garrison is holding fast.Moscow has also launched an assault farther south against Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-controlled bastion also in Donetsk province on high ground at the strategic intersection between the eastern and southern front lines.Weapons pledgesSince the New Year, Western countries have pledged hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles to Ukraine to give it the firepower and mobility to push through Russian lines and recapture occupied territory later this year.A new US package of weapons is expected to include longer-range rockets, which would give Ukraine the ability to hit Russian supply lines in all of the territory it occupies in Ukraine, including parts of the Crimean Peninsula.Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands on Tuesday promised at least 100 Leopard 1 A5 tanks will be delivered “in the coming months” and said they will come from industrial stock.The unscheduled visit to Ukraine from Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, come two weeks after Berlin agreed to provide tanks to help Ukraine counter Russian forces following intense pressure from Kyiv and many of Berlin’s European allies.Berlin has also promised Kyiv 14 of the newer Leopard 2 tanks.But it will likely take months before most of the promised weapons arrive, and meanwhile, Ukraine faces a Russian force with its manpower replenished through a call-up of reservists. The Kremlin argues that Western arms supplies would only widen and extend the conflict.“The US and its allies are trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible,” Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday in a conference call with military officials.“To do this, they have started supplying heavy offensive weapons, openly urging Ukraine to seize our territories,” he said. “In fact, such steps are dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of escalation.”His use of the phrase “our territories” appeared to refer to four Ukrainian provinces Russia unilaterally annexed last year and partially occupies as well as Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. The international community recognises all those areas as parts of Ukraine.Ukrainian service members ride a BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle near the front-line town of Bakhmut [Yevhen Titov/Reuters]In a daily intelligence update, the British Ministry of Defence said Russia’s military has been trying since early January to restart major offensive operations to capture Ukraine-held parts of the Donetsk region but had gained little ground so far.The Russians “lack munitions and manoeuvre units required for a successful offensive”, it said.Ukrainian officials say Moscow could be accumulating weapons and reserves for an even bigger push in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province predicted a big Russian offensive could begin there about February 15.On the political front, the past few weeks have seen a purge of Ukrainian officials in an anti-corruption campaign, the first big shake-up of Ukraine’s government since the war began.In his Monday evening address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said personnel changes on Ukraine’s borders and front lines would bolster its military efforts.But he gave no indication about the fate of his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The head of Zelenskyy’s party in parliament had said on Sunday that Reznikov would be replaced but said on Monday that no changes would be made this week.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.02214,0.30298,7527,18,8,19,0,2

108,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/6/un-chief-warns-of-wider-war-as-ukraine-conflict-intensifies,"United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned the world that it may be heading towards a “wider war” as the risk of a further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict rises.In a speech to the 193-member UN General Assembly on Monday presenting his 2023 priorities, Guterres decried the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying the war was “inflicting untold suffering on the Ukrainian people with profound global implications”.“The prospects for peace keep diminishing,” he said. “The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.“I fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war. I fear it is doing so with its eyes wide open.”The nearly year-long conflict has been intensifying in recent weeks with fierce battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces for control of towns in eastern Ukraine.Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Monday that the battle for the eastern Ukrainian region is “heating up” with Russian forces “throwing new units into the battle and eradicating our towns and villages”.Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year after Moscow amassed troops near the Ukrainian border and Putin demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.Moscow’s military campaign has suffered numerous setbacks as Western powers provide financial and military support to Kyiv.Russian officials have argued that sending arms to Ukraine is prolonging and intensifying the conflict.While the United States and its allies have said they do not seek a direct confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, US President Joe Biden has repeatedly warned Moscow against expanding the conflict, promising to protect “every inch” of NATO territory.Aside from the war in Ukraine, Guterres referenced other threats to peace, from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Afghanistan, Myanmar, the Sahel and Haiti.“If every country fulfilled its obligations under the [UN] Charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed,” he said,Guterres also sounded the alarm on Monday about the threats posed by climate change.“I have a special message for fossil fuel producers and their enablers scrambling to expand production and raking in monster profits: If you cannot set a credible course for net zero with 2025 and 2030 targets covering all your operations, you should not be in business,” Guterres said.Net zero is a climate target to bring emissions that fuel climate change to zero by reducing them and offsetting them, using natural and technological methods to prevent them from reaching the atmosphere.“Your core product is our core problem,” Guterres told the fossil fuel industry. “We need a renewables revolution, not a self-destructive fossil fuel resurgence.”Scientists warn that if the global community fails to drastically reduce emissions, the climate crisis will likely have catastrophic consequences for life on the planet.“We need to wake up – and get to work,” Guterres said.",0.03144,0.33192,2939,7,8,7,1,0

110,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/6/ukraine-to-replace-defence-minister-after-corruption-scandals,"Ukraine is set to replace defence minister Oleksii Reznikov with the chief of its military spy agency, a senior legislator has said, in a high-profile cabinet reshuffle following corruption scandals and ahead of an expected Russian offensive.Reznikov, 56, would be transferred to another ministerial job and replaced by Kyrylo Budanov, 37, who heads Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency, David Arakhamia said on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday.“War dictates personnel policies,” said Arakhamia, a close ally of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.There was no immediate statement from Zelenskyy on replacing Reznikov, a former lawyer who became defence minister in November 2021, a few months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022.Reznikov has helped secure Western weapons to buttress Ukrainian forces, and his removal as defence minister would be the highest-profile government change in a slew of resignations and sackings following a corruption scandal late last month and Zelenskyy’s pledge for Ukraine to meet Western standards of clean governance.The scandal involved food contracts that envisaged paying vastly inflated prices. Amid the public outcry, one of Reznikov’s deputy ministers has been fired, while two other senior officials have also since left their posts.Arakhamia said that Ukraine’s “force” agencies – like the defence ministry – should not be headed by politicians during wartime but by people with a background in defence or security.“Kyrylo Budanov will head the defence ministry, which is absolutely logical in wartime,” the legislator said.Holding the rank of major general, Budanov has headed the military intelligence since August 2020.“Time and circumstances require reinforcement and regrouping. This is happening now and will continue to happen in the future,” Arakhamia said. “The enemy is preparing to advance. We are preparing to defend ourselves,” he added, referring to Ukrainian fears that Russia is planning a vast new offensive this month.Ukraine is planning its own counteroffensive but is waiting for the arrival of battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles from Western allies.Arakhamia added that Reznikov would be made minister of strategic industries but did not say when the moves would be formalised.Reznikov had said earlier on Sunday that any decision on a reshuffle was up to Zelenskyy and that an internal audit of procurement procedures at the defence ministry was under way. The ministry’s own anti-corruption department had “failed” to do its job, he told reporters, and needed to be “completely rebooted”.He told the Ukrainian Fakty ICTV online media later in the evening that the transfer to the new ministry was news to him.“If I suddenly received such an offer from the president of Ukraine or the prime minister, I would refuse it, because I do not have the expertise,” Reznikov was quoted as saying.Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, when asked about the reshuffle on national television on Sunday night, said: “Reznikov was extremely efficient in terms of communication with our partners. And this is a very important component in this case.”Podolyak said that Reznikov’s “wonderful” personal relations with allies have helped Ukraine secure billions of dollars of military aid to fend off the Russian invasion.“Negotiations are not just mathematical formulae but also personal relationships. And trust. Unfortunately, today we are losing a measure of trust in us,” Podolyak said.Analysts said any decision to replace the defence minister would not affect Ukraine’s military operations.“The timing is not so important,” said William Courtney, senior fellow at the Rand Corporation, a United States-based think tank.“The main thing is that the new minister of defence be capable,” Courtney told Al Jazeera. “The new minister of defence would have to be the representative of the ministry of defence to the parliament, to the presidency, and also to many in the West. Oleksii Reznikov has enjoyed a good reputation in the West as an effective minister of defence, who understood the broad political implications of what was going on. Hopefully, the new minister will perform the same role and not seek to duplicate the military strategy functions.”",0.0792,0.3956,4262,8,3,4,0,4
111,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/5/mission-completed-ukraine-minister-says-warplanes-on-the-way,"Ukraine’s allies will agree to provide fighter aircraft to battle Russian forces, the defence minister said, despite recent comments by Western leaders that warplanes would not be forthcoming.Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov also told a news conference on Sunday that Russia will launch a major offensive in the coming weeks, but Ukraine has the soldiers and resources to repel such an attack.Ukraine’s military will halt the operation despite tanks and other weapon systems from the West not arriving in time, he said.“There will be planes, too,” Reznikov predicted. “The question is just what kind exactly … Consider that this mission is already completed.”So far Ukraine has won support from Baltic nations and Poland in its quest to obtain Western fighter jets. But several Western leaders have expressed concern that providing warplanes could provoke the Kremlin and draw their countries deeper into the conflict, which has cost tens of thousands of lives and wreaked massive destruction.Kyiv says such jets are essential to challenging Russia’s air superiority and ensuring success in a Russian offensive that Reznikov predicted could begin around the war’s one-year anniversary, February 24.“Not all Western weapons will arrive by then, but we have the resources and reserves to help stabilise and sustain the offensive,” Reznikov told reporters.Since the war began, Western officials have balked at some of Ukraine’s requests, such as for longer-range missiles and tanks, only to agree later. The warplanes are the latest example.‘De facto NATO country’Ukraine will not use longer-range weapons pledged by the United States to hit Russian territory and will only target Russian units in occupied Ukrainian territory, Reznikov said.The US confirmed on Friday that a new rocket doubling Ukraine’s strike range was included in a $2.2bn US military aid package to help Kyiv fight back Russian forces.“We always tell our partners officially that we will not use weapons supplied by foreign partners to fire on Russian territory. We only fire on Russian units on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory,” he said.German-made tanks are on the way to Ukraine. Reznikov said his forces would begin training on Leopard 2 tanks in Europe on Monday, before their delivery to Ukraine. So far, Canada, Poland, Germany, Britain and the United States have announced they will supply tanks to Ukraine.The Kremlin has said Western countries’ supply of increasingly sophisticated weapons will only prolong the conflict, and it has characterised NATO as a direct participant in the war.Reznikov, commenting on the supply of Western weapons and the state of the Ukrainian army, took the rhetoric further on Sunday, telling reporters: “I absolutely boldly claim that we have become a de facto NATO country. We only have a de jure part left.”Ukraine has applied to join NATO, as have two of Russia’s other neighbours, Finland and Sweden.‘Fighting to the last’Fighting is raging in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region as Russia intensifies pressure before the first anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.“Things are very difficult in Donetsk region – fierce battles,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “But however difficult it is and however much pressure there is, we must endure … We have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning.”Russia, he said, was applying increased pressure to “make up for its defeats last year. We see that on various sectors of the front and also pressure in terms of information.”Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said five civilians were wounded in rocket attacks in the city of Druzhkivka and the town of Avdiivka and its outskirts were also fired on.Heavy fighting was ongoing in Bakhmut. The head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said the Ukrainian army was not retreating and fighting raged on in northern parts of the eastern city.“Fierce battles are going on for every street, every house, every stairwell,” Prigozhin said in a statement. “The Ukrainian armed forces are fighting to the last.”Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four people were injured when a Russian S-300 missile fell near an apartment block in Kharkiv city, and another was hurt when a missile hit a university building.",0.05436,0.39118,4309,13,6,14,0,2
112,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/5/europe-bans-russian-diesel-and-other-oil-products-over-ukraine,"Europe has imposed a ban on Russian diesel fuel and other refined oil products, slashing energy dependency on Moscow and seeking to further crimp the Kremlin’s fossil fuel earnings as punishment for invading Ukraine.Sunday’s ban comes along with a price cap agreed by the Group of Seven (G7) allied countries – the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada.The goal is allowing Russian diesel to keep flowing to countries such as China and India and avoiding a sudden price rise that would hurt consumers worldwide while reducing the profits funding Moscow’s budget and war.Diesel is key for the economy because it is used to power cars, trucks carrying goods, farm equipment and factory machinery. Diesel prices have been elevated because of recovering demand after the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on refining capacity, contributing to inflation for other goods worldwide.The new sanctions create uncertainty about prices as the 27-nation European Union finds new supplies of diesel from the US, Middle East and India to replace those from Russia, which at one point delivered 10 percent of Europe’s total diesel needs. Those are longer journeys than from Russia’s ports, stretching available tankers.Neil Atkinson, a former International Energy Agency analyst, told Al Jazeera the EU sanctions on Russian products were unlikely to have a big impact on prices, at least initially.This is because companies worldwide have been building up stocks of Russian products ahead of the well-advertised ban, Atkinson said.“There is the possibility that if demand growth is very strong in the Asian economies … we could find that the lack of investment in parts of the oil industry infrastructure could lead to shortages and spikes in prices,” he said.G7’s price capThe G7 price cap of $100 per barrel for diesel, jet fuel and petrol is to be enforced by barring insurance and shipping services from handling diesel priced over the limit. Most of those companies are located in Western countries.It follows a $60-per-barrel cap on Russian crude that took effect in December and is supposed to work the same way. Both the diesel and oil caps could be tightened later.The diesel price cap will not bite immediately because it was set at about what Russian diesel trades for. Russia’s chief problem now will be finding new customers, not evading the price ceiling. However, the cap aims to prevent Russian gains from any sudden price spikes in refined oil products.Analysts say there might be a price bump initially as markets sort out the changes. But they say the embargo should not cause a price spike if the cap works as intended and Russian diesel keeps flowing to other countries.Diesel fuel at the pump has been flat since the start of December, costing 1.80 euros per litre ($7.37 per gallon) as of January 30, according to the weekly oil market report issued by the EU’s executive commission. Pump prices in Germany, the EU’s largest economy, fell 2.6 cents to 1.83 euros per litre ($7.48 per gallon) as of January 31.The ban provides for a 55-day grace period for diesel loaded on tankers before Sunday, a step that aims to prevent ruffling markets. EU officials say importers have had time to adjust since the ban was announced in June.Russia earned more than $2bn from diesel sales to Europe in December alone as importers appear to have stocked up with added purchases ahead of the ban.Europe has already banned Russian coal and most crude oil, while Moscow has cut off most shipments of natural gas.",0.02077,0.31528,3525,1,1,13,0,0
113,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/5/putin-promised-not-to-kill-zelenskyy-former-israeli-pm,"Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says he received a promise from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he will not kill his Ukrainian counterpart.Bennett emerged as an unlikely intermediary in the early days of Russia’s 11-month war with Ukraine, becoming one of the few leaders to meet Putin during the war in a trip to Moscow last March.While Bennett’s mediation efforts appear to have done little to end the ongoing bloodshed, his remarks, in an interview posted on his YouTube channel late on Saturday, shed light on the backroom diplomacy and urgent efforts that were under way to try to bring the conflict to a speedy conclusion in its early days.In the five-hour interview, which touched on numerous other subjects, Bennett says he asked Putin about whether he intended to kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“I asked ‘What’s with this? Are you planning to kill Zelenskyy?’ He said ‘I won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ I then said to him ‘I have to understand that you’re giving me your word that you won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ He said ‘I’m not going to kill Zelenskyy.’”Bennett said he then called Zelenskyy to inform him of Putin’s pledge.“’Listen, I came out of a meeting, he’s not going to kill you.’ He asks, ‘Are you sure?’ I said ‘One hundred percent he won’t kill you.’”Peacemaking effortsBennett said during his mediation, Putin dropped his demand to seek Ukraine’s disarmament and Zelenskyy promised not to join NATO.There was no immediate response from the Kremlin, which has previously denied Ukrainian claims that Russia intended to assassinate Zelenskyy.A Ukrainian presidential aide disputed Bennett’s comments.“Ex-official’s claims on ‘mediation’ that Putin allegedly gave ‘guarantees not to kill’ and ‘the West interrupted promising negotiations’ are fiction,” Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter.Podolyak said Russia’s “special military operation” is not about NATO expansion, security guarantees or sanctions, but rather based on Moscow’s desire to “destroy Ukraine and kill Ukrainians”.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also commented saying Putin is “an expert liar”.“In the past, Putin has made promises not to occupy Crimea, not to violate Minsk agreements, not to invade Ukraine, yet he has done all of these things. Do not be fooled … Every time he has promised not to do something, it has been exactly part of his plan,” Kuleba said.Power short livedBennett, a largely untested leader who had served as prime minister for just six months when the war broke out in February 2022, unexpectedly thrust himself into international diplomacy after he positioned Israel in an uncomfortable middle ground between Russia and Ukraine.Israel views its good ties with the Kremlin as strategic in the face of threats from Iran, but it aligns itself with Western nations and also seeks to show support for Ukraine.An observant Jew and little known internationally, Bennett flew to Moscow for his meeting with Putin during the Jewish Sabbath, breaking his religious commitments and putting himself at the forefront of global efforts to halt the war.However, his peacemaking efforts did not appear to take off and his time in power was short lived. Bennett’s government, an ideologically diverse union that sent current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into a brief political exile, collapsed in June 2022 over infighting.Bennett stepped away from politics and is now a private citizen.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00999,0.31389,4137,6,4,5,9,8

115,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/5/zelenskyy-says-situation-in-ukraines-east-getting-tougher,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that the situation on the eastern front line was getting tougher, with Russia throwing more and more troops into battle to break down Ukrainian defences.Zelenskyy’s comments on Saturday came as shelling continued in the eastern Donetsk region while an accident at a power plant in the southern region of Odesa left nearly 500,000 homes without electricity.“I’ve often had to say the situation at the front is tough, and is getting tougher, and it’s that time again. … The invader is putting more and more of his forces into breaking down our defences,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.“It is very difficult now in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Lyman and other directions,” he continued.Russian troops, who have been pushing for a significant battlefield victory after months of setbacks, have been trying to close their grip on the town of Bakhmut and are also trying to capture the nearby coal-mining city of Vuhledar, also in the eastern region of Donetsk.Earlier in the day, Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar wrote on Telegram that Russian efforts to break the defences in Bakhmut and Lyman had failed.Lyman, which lies just to the north of Bakhmut, was liberated by Ukrainian forces in October.“This week, the Russian occupation forces threw all their efforts into breaking through our defence and encircling Bakhmut, and launched a powerful offensive in the Lyman sector,” Malyar said. “But thanks to the resilience of our soldiers, they did not succeed.”Ukraine’s border guard service reported that its soldiers killed four and wounded seven opposing forces as they fought off the latest attack.The fighting around Bakhmut has been costly for Russia in terms of soldiers’ lives, the Kremlin admitted.Russia’s independent news outlet Meduza reported in late January that some 40,000 of the 50,000 recruits by the powerful Wagner private military group involved in the campaign there were either dead or missing.Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the reports.Foreign casualtiesUkrainian officials meanwhile reported continued shelling in the Chernihiv, Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk and Mykolaiv regions.They also reported recovering the bodies of two British volunteers killed trying to help evacuate people from the eastern warzone. They were identified as Chris Parry, 28, and Andrew Bagshaw, 47.The pair died after their vehicle was reportedly hit by a shell in Soledar, in the Donetsk region, and their bodies were returned to Ukraine authorities as part of a wider exchange, in which Kyiv got 116 prisoners and Russia 63.“We managed to return the bodies of the dead foreign volunteers,” said Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, naming them as the two British men.In Odesa, officials reported that a fire caused by an accident at an overloaded substation had cut electricity across the southern region.“As of today, almost 500,000 customers have no electricity supply,” said Maksym Marchenko of the Odesa regional administration. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that came to “about a third of consumers” there.“The situation is complex, the scale of the accident is significant,” Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on messaging app Telegram.Ukrenergo, the country’s energy operator, said the power network there had been gradually degraded by repeated Russian bombardment in recent months. “As a result, the reliability of power supply in the region has decreased.”Also on Saturday, Canada shipped the first of four promised Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand said on Twitter.France, Italy and the United States have all promised new deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, and Kyiv, while expressing its gratitude for the pledged weapons, is already pressing for more, including fighter jets.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meanwhile said in an interview there was agreement that weapons supplied by the West would not be used to attack Russian territory.“There is a consensus on this point,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the weekly Bild am Sonntag.

116,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/4/fire-at-odesa-power-substation-leaves-port-citys-grid-on-brink,"A fire broke out at an overloaded electrical substation in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Saturday, leaving nearly 500,000 people without power in a new blow to the country’s ailing energy grid that has been hammered by Russian attacks for months.Officials warned that repairs could take weeks. The government said it would appeal to Turkey for help and ordered the energy ministry’s stocks of high-power generators to be sent to the Black Sea city.The CEO of the state grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said critical equipment that had already been damaged several times by Russian missile attacks burst into flames when it could no longer “withstand the load”.“[The equipment] has been struck so many times that its state leaves much to be desired,” Kudrytskyi told a briefing in Odesa.He said any further Russian missile or drone attacks could make the situation even worse.“We will do everything we can for the improvement of the power supply situation to take days rather than weeks,” he said.Since October, Russian forces have waged a campaign of massive missile attacks on energy infrastructure. Moscow says the raids aimed to reduce Ukraine’s ability to fight; Kyiv has said they have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians.“The situation is complex, the scale of the accident is significant,” Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on messaging app Telegram. He added that the substation had been “repeatedly” damaged as a result of Russian attacks.Odesa regional Governor Maksym Marchenko described the accident as “serious,” adding that the energy minister and the head of state-run electricity grid operator Ukrenergo had been sent to the city.As of Saturday afternoon, about 500,000 people faced outages, he said. That figure represented about half of Odesa’s pre-war population of one million, when it was Ukraine’s third-largest city.“Today’s power supply [availability] allows to supply the city and the district about 40 or 45 percent, but if we factor in critical infrastructure, then, of course, very little is left for ordinary citizens,” Kudrytskyi said.The temperature in Odesa stood at 2C (35.6F) on Saturday and is due to dip below freezing for much of next week.Prime Minister Shmyhal said he had ordered Ukraine’s energy ministry to scramble every available high-power generator in its nationwide inventory and deliver it to Odesa within a day.He also ordered Ukraine’s foreign ministry to appeal to Turkey to send powerships – vessels that carry power plants – to come to the city’s aid.At the briefing, Kudrytskyi said the city’s critical infrastructure facilities were now being supplied with power.Odesa was a favourite holiday destination for many Ukrainians and Russians before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine last February.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00457,0.34787,3496,5,2,6,0,0
117,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/4/dozens-of-soldiers-freed-in-russia-ukraine-prisoner-swap,"Ukraine has released dozens of Russian soldiers as part of a negotiation brokered by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Russia’s defence ministry has said, the same day 116 Ukrainian servicemen were also freed as fighting rages in the eastern city of Bakhmut.“A complicated negotiations process resulted in 63 Russian servicemen returned from the Ukrainian territory”, the ministry said on Saturday, as quoted by TASS news agency. It added that people of a “sensitive category” were also included in the deal, thanks to the mediation of the Gulf country.The ministry did not provide details on who falls within the “sensitive” group, but experts say that in past exchanges it referred to a wide range of people, including spies and civilians holding sensitive information.All of the released soldiers are currently in Russia, the ministry said, adding that they were being given medical aid and access to contact their families.The UAE maintains close ties with Moscow and remains one of the countries not supporting Western sanctions against Russia.Last October, President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ) and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Saint Petersburg where the Russian leader described relations between the two countries as “an important factor of stability”.While the Russian ministry did not refer to the event as a prisoner exchange in its comments on Saturday, later the same day Ukraine’s presidency confirmed the release of 116 Ukrainians, including fighters caught in the battle of Mariupol and Kherson.The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War posted a message on its Telegram channel saying that the liberation came as part of an operation that took place “in several stages”.Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) pose for a picture after a swap in an unknown location in Ukraine in this handout picture released on February 4, 2023 [Press Service of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces/Handout via Reuters]A majority of 87 of those freed were from the Ukrainian regular arm forces. Eight servicemen were from military intelligence while others belonged to the navy and the national guards. At least 23 of the released were injured or sick, the Ukrainian office said, adding that some have lost limbs due to frostbite.The Coordination Headquarters also said that the repatriation of the bodies of British volunteers, Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Perry, took place as part of the operation.Prisoners’ exchanges between the two countries have become more regular in recent months. In a surprise move in September, more than 300 soldiers were swapped, marking the largest exchange since Moscow’s invasion last February. Two more took place in December and the latest in January saw Ukraine and Russia freeing at least 50 prisoners each.“This marks a successful exchange, a dialogue,” said Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi. “As much as the two countries continue to build walls between them during the war, it is exchanges like these that show that there are cracks on the wall and that there is enough daylight to continue to swap prisoners and bodies,” Basravi said, reporting from Kyiv.The release of prisoners on both sides comes as intense fighting continues around Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region.Moscow says Russian forces are encircling the city from several directions and battling to take control of a road that is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces.In a defiant comment on Friday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that no one will surrender Bakhmut. “We will fight as long as we can,” he said, standing shoulder to shoulder with European Council President Charles Michel, who was on his second visit to Kyiv in less than three weeks, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Ukrainian servicemen fire a 2S7 Pion self-propelled gun toward Russian positions, amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, on a frontline near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.

We will fight as long as we can,” Zelenskyy said, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with President of the European Council Charles Michel, who was on his second visit to Kyiv in less than three weeks, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.“If weapon (deliveries) are accelerated – namely long-range weapons – we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas,” Zelenskyy added, referring to the eastern region comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.Moscow says Russian forces are encircling Bakhmut from several directions and battling to take control of a road that is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces.Zelenskyy’s defiant comments on the battle for Bakhmut came at the end of a two-day visit of several senior European Union officials to Kyiv, during which the Ukrainian leader called for his country’s rapid accession to the regional bloc.Zelenskyy has been clear he wants Ukraine to join the EU as fast as possible and has said he wants the discussions to start this year.“Our goal is absolutely clear: to start negotiations on Ukraine’s membership,” he said on Friday. “We will not lose a single day in our work to bring Ukraine and the EU closer together.”In June last year, just months after the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine, the EU extended candidate status to Kyiv but the path to full membership is likely to be fraught and could take years.Von der Leyen and Michel reiterated the EU’s unwavering support for Ukraine during the Kyiv meeting.Michel doubled down on his backing for Kyiv’s integration with Brussels, saying: “Ukraine is the EU, the EU is Ukraine.”“Your future is with us. Your destiny is our destiny,” Michel wrote in a tweet.The Ukrainian people have made a clear choice for freedom, democracy, and rule of law. And we in the EU have also made a clear decision.Your future is with us. Your destiny is our destiny.That’s why we are here today. Standing by your side.@ZelenskyyUa #EUUkraine pic.twitter.com/c3uNs1GnGX— Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel) February 3, 2023The EU released a statement on Friday acknowledging that Ukraine had made “considerable efforts” to advance towards membership but urged Kyiv to implement further reforms.Corruption is a key EU concern and Ukraine has widened efforts to tackle the issue with highly-publicised raids this week on an oligarch with political connections and a former interior minister.“You are at war and, while being at war and defending your country against the aggressor, you’re able to deliver one deliverable after the next that is necessary to move forward,” von der Leyen said.But she also cautioned that the process of accession was merit-based and said there could be “no rigid timelines” put in place for Ukrainian membership or talks.Battle for BakhmutThroughout Friday morning, steady fighting continued in Bakhmut.Smoke could be seen rising from the city centre, behind the golden-domed All Saints Church, and Ukrainian helicopters flew low towards Bakhmut over the frozen countryside to the northwest, the Agence-France Presse news agency reported.A Belarusian volunteer fighting for Ukraine inside the city said there was no sign yet that Ukrainian forces were planning to pull out.“For the moment it’s the opposite, the positions are being reinforced where the Russians are trying to cut us off… We’re holding for now,” he told the Reuters news agency.A charity helping residents in the war-battered town said an attack on a car carrying volunteer paramedics killed one and injured several others the day before.An investigation was under way but it could take several days to determine the identity of the victim after reports that foreign nationals may have been involved, a police official said.Oleksandr Tkachenko, 65, said he and three other locals rushed to help when the car was hit, managing to pull an injured woman free from the vehicle.He said it was “clear” that the car, which was destroyed in the attack, was not a military target.Locals involved in the rescue were not soldiers, he added, but they also came under attack and were injured in a second attack as they tried to help.“I don’t know how we didn’t get torn apart. I got shrapnel in my leg,” added Tkachenko, limping towards a community centre with the help of a walking stick.",0.03296,0.33156,4802,12,7,2,0,7
120,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/3/eu-agrees-price-caps-on-russian-oil-products,"Western allies have pledged precision rockets and missile systems to Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for sophisticated weapons to help retain control of the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut.The European Union also agreed to introduce price caps on Russian petroleum products to try further limit Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war chest by targeting his key exports.The announcements on Friday came shortly after Zelenskyy told a summit with EU leaders in Kyiv: “No one will surrender Bakhmut. We will fight as long as we can.“If weapon (deliveries) are accelerated – namely long-range weapons – we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas,” he said of the region in eastern Ukraine.The United States announced a new $2.2bn package of arms and munitions, which the Pentagon said included a new rocket-propelled precision bomb that could nearly double Ukraine’s strike range against Russian forces.The ground-launched small-diameter bombs (GLSDB), which can fly up to 150 kilometres (93 miles), could threaten key Russian supply lines, arms depots and air bases far behind the front lines.Ukraine had been asking Washington for munitions that can fly farther than the HIMARS rockets, which have an 80km range.The GLSDBs potentially give Kyiv’s forces the ability to strike anywhere in the partly Russian-occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, and the northern part of occupied Crimea.The French defence ministry said France and Italy would deliver mobile surface-to-air missile systems in response to an urgent request from Kyiv to help protect “civilian populations and infrastructure from Russian air attacks”.The systems, called MAMBA or SAMP, are a vehicle-mounted battery of medium-range missiles designed to offer protection from airborne threats such as missiles and crewed or uncrewed aircraft.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said the weapons would “help us save thousands of lives” from Russian attacks.Kyiv is also asking for fighter jets.It has already secured promises from the West for deliveries of modern battle tanks and, after months of hesitation, Germany authorised the delivery of Leopard 1 tanks.Russian oil products price capIn Brussels, EU countries agreed to cap the price of Russian refined oil products to accompany an embargo on ship deliveries of the products that comes into force on Sunday.“EU ambassadors today approved the price caps on petroleum products ahead of final adoption by the European Council (representing EU member states),” the Swedish presidency of the European Union wrote on Twitter on Friday.The EU in December imposed an embargo on Russian crude oil coming in by sea and – together with its G7 partners – set a $60-per-barrel cap for exports around the world.The second EU-wide embargo, on Russian fuel, is set to come into force on Sunday. It will target Russian refined oil products such as petrol, diesel and heating fuel arriving on ships.At the same time, the EU and the G7 group of wealthy democracies have also agreed to impose a price cap on Russian shipments of those products to global markets.The price caps work by establishing a ceiling for the cost of fuel that can be transported on EU ships.The Swedish EU presidency said the price caps were an “important agreement as part of the continued response by EU and partners to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine”.It did not detail the price cap levels for different petroleum products.The Reuters news agency cited EU diplomats saying the price caps agreed to were $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, such as diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil. The proposal was that they apply from Sunday.Poland and Baltic states Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had pushed for the caps to be set at lower levels to curb Russia’s revenues from fuel, diplomats had said, dragging on talks for days.Setting the levels is a sensitive issue as the West does not want to cut off Russian supplies to world markets entirely and send global prices soaring.The Kremlin lashed out at the EU in advance of the embargo coming into force, insisting it will “lead to a further imbalance of the international energy markets”.“We are taking measures to hedge our interests against the risks associated,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Moscow’s war in Ukraine has provided a harsh wake-up call for the EU, which for years had been reliant on cheap fossil fuels from Russia to power its industries.Brussels says the embargo on crude oil has seen the bloc cut out some 90 percent of Russian imports, after exceptions were granted for supplies flowing by pipeline to landlocked countries like Hungary.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday estimated during a visit to Kyiv that the existing price cap on Russian oil was already costing Moscow approximately 160 million euros ($175m) every day.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.01538,0.3971,5705,6,3,19,1,2

Most of the city was reduced to rubble before Nazi forces surrendered on February 2, 1943.It was a major turning point in WWII and the battle remains an immense source of pride in modern Russia, lauded as a demonstration of military might and moral seriousness.The city was renamed in 1961 as part of the Soviet Union’s rejection of dictator Joseph Stalin’s personality cult. Calls for the restoration of its old name have not received the Kremlin’s blessing.As Russian forces struggle to gain ground in Ukraine, politicians from the dominant United Russia party have been told to liken the Ukraine fight to Stalingrad, the newspaper Kommersant reported.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05728,0.35902,3231,6,3,9,5,1
125,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/2/top-eu-officials-arrive-in-ukraine-ahead-of-summit,"European Union leaders have arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukraine’s government, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but disappointing Ukraine’s hopes for swift membership to the EU.The head of the group’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv by train on Thursday, a symbolic journey to demonstrate support for Ukraine as the first anniversary of Russia’s February 24 invasion nears.Senior members of the EU’s executive met their counterparts in the Ukrainian government and von der Leyen and the chairman of the 27 EU national leaders, Charles Michel, will convene talks with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy on Friday.Zelenskyy has urged the EU to impose more punitive measures against Russia, but the 10th round of sanctions the bloc is preparing for the anniversary are likely to fall short of the Kyiv government’s demands.“Today … we reached a very important mutual understanding,” Zelenskyy said in his Thursday night video address. “That only together – a strong Ukraine and a strong European Union – can we defend the life that we value, and through our further integration, provide energy and motivation for our people to fight on regardless of obstacles and threats.”The gathering is the first of its kind to take place in Kyiv since the Russian invasion.EU states have offered Kyiv political, economic and military backing throughout the war and von der Leyen told reporters during a news conference on Thursday alongside Zelenskyy, that existing sanctions were “eroding” Russia’s economy and “throwing it back by a generation”.Multiple requirements for membershipBut despite the shows of solidarity, Ukraine’s desire to join the bloc is unlikely to be met anytime soon.After a recent Ukrainian crackdown on high-level corruption, EU leaders are set to dash Kyiv’s hopes of swift membership by underlining the need for more anti-corruption measures.Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, said Ukraine “wants to be part of the European Union and turn to the West”.“It says this is part of what it is fighting [against Russia] for,” Butler said.“The EU, though, is likely to send the message that there is still a lot of work to be done in order for Ukraine to reach the criteria to become a full EU member.”The EU has listed multiple requirements for Ukraine to join the bloc, from political and economic stability to adopting several of its laws.Kyiv was granted membership candidate status at record speed last June, but full ascension could take several years yet, if not longer.The last country to join the EU was Croatia in 2013, a decade after formally applying. Poland, Ukraine’s neighbour, waited for 20 years before becoming a member in 2004.‘Europe stood united with Ukraine from day one’EU officials told the Reuters news agency this week’s meetings would address more arms and money for Ukraine as well as more access for Ukrainian products to the EU market and helping Kyiv cover its energy needs.Sanctions on Russia, prosecuting Russia’s leadership for the war, and extending an EU no-roaming mobile calls zone to Ukraine would also be discussed, the officials said.The EU has already earmarked almost 60 billion euros ($65bn) in aid to Ukraine, including nearly 12 billion euros ($13.2bn) of military support and 18 billion euros ($19.8bn) to help run the country this year.Further underpinning Kyiv’s response to Russia’s offensive, the EU’s Borrell on Thursday announced doubling the number of Ukrainian troops to be trained by the bloc to 30,000 this year. He also promised 25 million euros ($27.5m) for de-mining areas recaptured by Ukraine.“Europe stood united with Ukraine from day one. And will still stand with you to win and rebuild,” Borrell wrote on Twitter.The EU’s top officials for migration, agriculture, economy and justice are also in the Ukrainian capital.",0.14143,0.37321,3858,15,2,9,0,4
126,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/2/analysis-ukraines-new-weapon-will-force-a-russian-shift,"With the United States expected to send a new longer-range weapon to Ukraine, it has answered President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s plea for rockets that can strike deep behind the front lines of the nearly year-long conflict with Russia.Now Russian forces will need to adapt or face potentially catastrophic losses.The new weapon, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), will allow Ukraine’s military to hit targets at twice the distance reachable by the rockets it now fires from the US-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).If included as expected in an upcoming weapons-aid package first reported by the Reuters news agency, the 151-kilometre (94-mile) GLSDB will put all of Russia’s supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea.This will force Russia to move its supplies even farther from the front lines, making its soldiers more vulnerable and greatly complicating plans for any new offensive.“This could slow down [a Russian assault] significantly,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister. “Just as HIMARS significantly influenced the course of events, these rockets could influence the course of events even more.”GLSDB is a GPS-guided glide bomb that can manoeuvre to hit hard-to-reach targets such as command centres. Made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co, it combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories.It is not yet compatible with HIMARS, but the US will provide Ukraine with new launchers for the rockets, sources said. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.Vulnerable supply linesWhen the US first sent HIMARS launchers in June, it supplied rockets with a 77km (48-mile) range. This was a major boost for the Ukrainian military, allowing it to destroy Russian ammunition dumps and weapons storage facilities.Once Ukraine has the new glide bombs, say military experts, Russia will need to push its supplies even farther away.“We are currently unable to reach Russian military facilities more than 80 kilometres away,” said Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko. “If we can reach them practically all the way to the Russian border, or in occupied Crimea, then of course this will lower the attacking potential of Russian forces.”Crucially, Ukraine will soon be able to reach every point of the occupied overland route to Crimea via Berdyansk and Melitopol. That will force Russia to redirect its supply trucks to the Crimean bridge, which was badly damaged in an attack in October.“Russia is using Crimea as a big military base from which it sends reinforcements for its troops on the southern front,” said Musiyenko. “If we had a 150km (munition), we could reach that and disrupt the logistical connection with Crimea.”Beyond the logistical impact, the addition of a longer-range weapon to Ukraine’s arsenal could help shake Russian confidence.Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that while Ukraine would benefit from an even longer-range weapon, GLSDB is “a really important step to give the Ukrainians longer reach and to keep the Russians guessing”.No ATACMS – yetFor US President Joe Biden’s administration, the decision to send GLSDB to Ukraine represents a step towards meeting Ukraine’s demand for the 297km (185-mile) range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missile, which the administration has so far declined to provide, fearing a further escalation of the conflict.The glide bombs, while not as powerful, are much cheaper, smaller and easier to deploy than ATACMS, making them well suited for much of what Ukraine hopes to accomplish: disrupting Russian operations and creating a tactical advantage.Still, said Karako, it is possible the Ukrainians could end up receiving an even longer-range weapon in the future.“Time and again, we’ve seen the administration say that they would go up to a certain point, but not beyond,” he said. “Then, as the situation has deteriorated, they’ve found the necessity to, in fact, go further.”This was the case with HIMARS, the Patriot missile defence system, and, just this month, Abrams tanks, all initially off-limits to Ukraine before the administration ended up approving shipments.But for now, the focus will be on how quickly the new glide bombs can arrive in Ukraine, said Zagorodnyuk.“If they speed it up … this could hugely change the situation on the field of battle.”Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.03032,0.39969,5256,13,1,16,0,1

The attacks included continued Russian shelling of Kherson city.Russian President Vladimir Putin told a government meeting that shelling of Russian regions from Ukraine must not be permitted, according to reports by state media outlets.Military aidThe head of Russia’s SVR Foreign Intelligence Service accused NATO of “raising the stakes” in Ukraine by supplying Kyiv with additional military support.Germany’s defence minister showed off the tanks Berlin is preparing to send to Kyiv but recognised a “bitter loss” for the under-equipped German military.Ukraine’s defence minister said that Ukrainian lives will be saved by a sophisticated air-defence radar that France is supplying to Kyiv.The United States is readying more than $2bn worth of military aid for Ukraine which is expected to include longer-range rockets for the first time.The Kremlin said the US will escalate the war in Ukraine, albeit not change its course, if it supplies Ukraine with longer-range rockets.The United Kingdom has not made a “solid decision” not to send its fighter jets to Ukraine but does not think it is the right approach at the moment, Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said.Diplomacy and energyThe US accused Russia of violating the New START Treaty, the last major pillar of post-Cold War nuclear arms control.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara looks positively on Finland’s application for NATO membership but does not support Sweden’s bid.Sweden is implementing an initial deal agreed with Turkey on its NATO membership but compromises on freedom of expression are not part of the pact, Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said.The US imposed sanctions on 22 individuals and entities in multiple countries that Washington accused of being tied to a global sanctions evasion network supporting Russia’s military-industrial complex.Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen visited Kyiv for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart.The International Energy Agency does not expect major supply problems or disruptions from a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products.",0.05741,0.25367,2652,8,3,10,1,0
128,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/home-of-ukrainian-oil-tycoon-raided-in-anti-corruption-purge,"Ukrainian authorities raided an influential billionaire’s home in what an ally of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy touted as a sweeping wartime clampdown on corruption that would change the country.Ihor Kolomoisky held shares in two oil companies, Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta, which had both been seized under martial law last November after Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said it uncovered the embezzlement of more than $1bn.“Every criminal who has the audacity to harm Ukraine, especially in the conditions of war, must clearly understand that we will put handcuffs on his hands,” Ukraine’s security service chief Vasyl Malyuk said on the SBU Telegram channel.Separate raids were carried out at the tax office and the home of Arsen Avakov, who led Ukraine’s police force as interior minister from 2014-2021.SBU said it was cracking down on “people whose actions harm the security of the state in various spheres” and promised more details in the next few days.Kolomoisky, currently facing a fraud case in the US, has been at the centre of corruption allegations and court disputes for years, which Western aid donors have said must be resolved for Kyiv to continue gaining support.Many also questioned whether Zelenskyy would act against Kolomoisky after having risen to fame in a sitcom on his TV station.David Arakhamia, a senior member of Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, confirmed the search of Kolomoisky’s home, as well as the separate raids.Arakhamia said the entire management of the Customs Service was set to be dismissed and high-ranking defence ministry officials had been served with notices informing them they were suspects in a case.“The country will change during the war. If someone is not ready for change, then the state itself will come and help them change,” Arakhamia wrote on the Telegram messaging app.In a statement, the prosecutor general’s office later said “corruption in a time of war is looting”.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European Council President Charles Michel [Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via Reuters]Government shake-up Ukraine’s long-running battle against corruption has taken on vital significance as Russia’s invasion has made Kyiv heavily reliant on Western support and it needs to carry out reforms to join the 27-nation EU.The raids come days before a European Union summit where Ukraine is expected to seek concrete steps into joining the 27-member bloc.In Zelenskyy’s Tuesday night address, he discussed further anti-corruption measures that would come into effect.“We are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,” he said.In 2021, Ukraine ranked 122 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Index.Last week, more than a dozen senior officials were removed from their positions following a series of scandals and corruption allegations in the biggest shake-up of Ukraine’s wartime government.With the influx of Western funds, Zelenskyy, who came into office pledging to combat corruption before the invasion began, is hoping to clean up the country’s image.",0.08925,0.33423,3187,10,5,1,0,6
129,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/western-weapons-deliveries-are-in-a-race-against-a-renewed-russia,"Ukraine has won new weapons pledges that will help it launch a major counteroffensive later this year, but Russia has tried to take back the initiative in the 49th week of the war.Ukraine faced intensifying battles in the east where Russian regular troops were injecting new vigour into fronts held by mercenaries from the Wagner Group, mounting new offensives and incrementally gaining ground.The hammer has fallen hardest in the eastern city of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian unit commander Denys Yarolavskyi said “super qualified” Russian troops were pouring in during the week. Those included elite airborne troops that reportedly made marginal gains in Bakhmut on January 29 and 30.In a single 24-hour period, Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said on January 31 that 42 battles had taken place within 15km (9 miles) of Bakhmut in the region of Donetsk.Russian troops launched a new battle against Vuhledar, a town 30km (19 miles) southwest of the occupied Donetsk city on January 27. Ukrainian defenders repulsed them but geolocated footage suggested they captured the village of Mykilske on the southeastern outskirts of Vuhledar.Russian forces also conducted a reconnaissance-in-force in the neighbouring Luhansk region on January 27, breaking through Ukrainian defences near the village of Ternova.Further north, they stepped up cross-border artillery attacks. The Ukrainian state border service said 60 explosions were heard in the Sumy and Chernihiv regions on January 26, far from the battlefront. The explosions were 120mm shells being fired from Russian territory.And Russia continued its blitz, launching 55 air and sea-based cruise missiles and 24 Iranian drones into Ukraine on January 26. Ukraine’s air defences shot down 47 of the missiles and all 24 drones.The surviving missiles caused no casualties but the next day, three people were killed and 14 wounded when Russian S-300 missiles struck the town of Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region.Weapons pledges come inAfter the attack on Kostyantynivka, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his call for longer-range weapons.“Ukraine needs long-range missiles, in particular, in order to remove this possibility of the occupier to place its missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them,” Zelenskyy said.As if in response, two United States defence officials told the Reuters news agency a forthcoming $2bn package of military aid could include some of the longer-range weapons Ukraine has been asking for.The Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) has a range of 150km (93 miles), double that of the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) the US provided last June. The bombs would put all of the occupied and partly occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions within range of Ukrainian forces.That is important because Russia has been learning from its mistakes and was placing ammunition depots 80-120km (50-75 miles) from the front line in the Russian region of Rostov, out of range of HIMARS rocket artillery, said Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitskyi.“If you ask what’s critical for the Russian Federation, the centres of gravity are these very hubs and they need to be struck in order to disrupt the supply systems of all kinds,” Skibitskyi said.Longer-range weapons would also help Ukraine soften Russian defence positions ahead of a counteroffensive, Skibitskyi said.Battle tanksUkrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said Ukraine was to be supplied with the French-Italian Aster 30 surface-to-air missile, which also has a range of up to 150km (93 miles), in what may have been a coordinated decision with that of supplying the GLSDB.The US has still not approved giving Ukraine the 300km (186-mile) range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) rocket it wants.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on January 27 said Poland would give Ukraine 60 modern tanks, including a company of Leopard 2 tanks.That brought to 119 the number of Western battle tanks allies have now pledged, including 14 Leopard 2s from Germany, 14 Challenger 2 tanks from the United Kingdom, and 31 Abrams M1 tanks from the US.That is still far short of the 300 battle tanks Ukraine has said it needs to take back all of its occupied territories, and they may not all arrive quickly.Valuable time – and lives – lostAnalysts have suspected for some time that Russian President Vladimir Putin is planning a significant counteroffensive and evidence of that mounted in the 49th week of the war.Bloomberg quoted Kremlin sources as saying Putin was planning a late winter offensive to take back the initiative.“Putin remains convinced that Russia’s larger forces and willingness to accept casualties … will allow it to prevail despite the failings so far. The renewed offensive may start as soon as February or March, the people close to the Kremlin said,” Bloomberg wrote.Germany’s company of Leopard 2 tanks and the UK’s company of Challenger 2 tanks are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine at the end of March, while US Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the Abrams tanks would “take months rather than weeks”.A Russian offensive in the next two months could catch Ukrainian forces unequipped, which has led to harsh criticism of Western indecision.The Royal United Services Institute’s ground war expert, Jack Watling, said Germany’s insistence on the US pledging Abrams tanks before it pledged Leopards lost valuable time and complicated Ukraine’s defence.“Thanks to the obstructionism and incompetence of the German government, Ukraine has ended up with the worst of the positive outcomes available. Rather than receiving a large number of a single type of tank they are receiving three different NATO-designed tanks, all in limited numbers and each with separate, complex maintenance requirements. This will delay getting these tanks to the front lines,” Watling wrote.Russia is using its attacks in the Donbas to draw Ukrainian soldiers into an attritional fight and hobble their ability to man a counteroffensive in the spring, Watling said.The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukraine’s counteroffensives have depended on Western weapons deliveries and delays have weakened its defences.“If allies had started transitioning Ukraine to Western battle tanks, aircraft and armoured vehicles in early summer 2022, the Russians would never have had the chance to regain the initiative, as they are now attempting to do,” said ISW.If Ukraine is unequipped to launch a winter offensive, the muddy spring weather may force it to wait until early summer to do so, allowing Russia to make even more incremental territorial gains, the ISW said.Better late than neverIt appears the urgency of the situation has begun to sink in. The US Transportation Command said 60 Bradley Fighting Vehicles promised last month had already been shipped to Ukraine and posted photographs on social media showing them being loaded in Charleston, South Carolina in the US.Allies also began to address the long-term nature of the war facing Ukraine, given Putin’s apparent intention of doubling down.Ukraine’s general staff said France and Australia were embarking on a collaboration to produce 155mm shells for its artillery.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said German defence manufacturer Rheinmetall was prepared to step up production of tanks and artillery to meet Ukrainian demand.The US is increasing artillery shell production sixfold – a level not seen since the Korean War – to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine, supply Ukraine with more and build up stocks for future conflicts. According to a New York Times report, the US Army was buying 14,400 shells a month until September 2022, when it tripled that, and in January 2023 doubled it again to 90,000.But some Ukraine allies are still drawing the line at air power.

I couldn’t believe it, and I didn’t want to believe it. But it was a hard time for us all,” Slava said.Having grown up in northern Ukraine, Volodymyr worked as an online games tester and developer in the capital city, Kyiv.He helped create a popular game called Stalker. The face of one of the game’s characters was modelled on his.The brothers, Volodymyr and Slava Yezhov, grew up in northern Ukraine [Courtesy: Slava Yezhov]As the brothers communicated via a messaging app, Slava said it was increasingly clear how much the war was impacting Volodymyr by the expressions on his face.But even as he mourns, he still believes Volodymyr would not have backed out.“I am sure that he would have done it again,” he said.Ukraine says more than 13,000 soldiers have been killed in the war. Russia rarely acknowledges its losses; in September Moscow said 6,000 troops had been killed.The real numbers are feared to be much higher than official tolls. A top United States general recently said about 100,000 soldiers on both sides had likely been killed.Volodymyr Yezhov, who was killed in December, left behind his family and two young children [Courtesy: Slava Yezhov]",0.09468,0.44807,2374,7,3,5,0,0

132,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/life-as-a-imprisoned-social-worker-in-donetsk,"Natalya Zelenina, who hails from Donetsk in Ukraine, was 35 when she stopped using hard drugs and began opioid substitution therapy (OST).She then became a social worker and spent her days helping others who wanted to quit street drugs.In 2017, as she travelled around eastern Ukraine for work, she was stopped on the border of Donetsk by Russia-backed separatists who had seized the region three years earlier.The so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) is recognised globally as Ukraine’s territory but has been run by pro-Kremlin rebels since 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk region.The rebel officials accused Zelenina of drug trafficking, and after a trial she says was a sham, she was sentenced to 11 years in prison.When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, Zelenina feared her chances of a pardon had shrunk to zero.But on October 17, the Donetsk native was among 108 women freed from Russian captivity in a prisoner exchange.As the war stretches into its 12th month, Zelenina has returned to social work in Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian-controlled city in northern Donetsk.108 Ukrainian women were released on October 17 in a prisoner swap with Russia, including Natalya Zelenina [File: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/AFP]This is her story, as told to Al Jazeera:I used drugs for 15 years – hard drugs, opioids. When I started opioid substitution therapy, OST, in 2006, my life changed completely. I refused to get any more street drugs.I became a social worker in Donetsk. With my own experience, I could help others. I could show that it’s possible to quit street drugs and that HIV is not a death sentence.When the war began [in 2014], I was terrified that people would arrest us and take away all our medicine because Russia doesn’t have OST programmes.There was a lot at stake. We had seen the progress of people on OST, so we couldn’t just say that we were afraid and stop our work.In 2015, the DPR state began to track harm reduction organisations. They threatened us. We had to close that office and move.Then on November 4, 2017, I was crossing the checkpoint in Olenivka, headed to Donetsk. I was carrying prescribed buprenorphine for myself and one other patient. They told me I was carrying illegal substances.I was interrogated for three days in the Donetsk police station, and they [the self-appointed DPR authorities] took all my medicine. Soon, I felt very, very bad due to the withdrawal. It was really painful.I couldn’t control my thoughts. I fell down and lost consciousness at one point. They didn’t feed me, and the most they’d do was give me a tiny amount of water.Initially, they wanted me to sign a paper saying I’d bought the drugs illegally and was trying to sell them in Donetsk, but I refused.That’s why they banned me from seeing my mother and nephew. They said I had to confess, or I’d go to jail for 25 years.But I can’t admit to what I didn’t do. I was acting within the framework of Ukrainian law, so everything was legal.They brought in a boy who was addicted to drugs and beat him in front of me. They said it would be the same with me if I didn’t sign the documents.After three days, they put me in a temporary detention centre. By that time, I understood it was serious. They weren’t going to just let me go. I felt there was not enough air. When I was brought to this detention centre, I just couldn’t breathe.On my third day in the detention centre, they charged me with drug trafficking. I didn’t really expect a fair trial.When you are in prison, you perceive things in a very different way, so I had really severe depression. I wasn’t able to sleep. It could have been much worse.In prison, I saw people who fainted or felt really bad because they didn’t receive proper treatment. And I wasn’t receiving OST or antiretroviral therapy [ART].My ART was interrupted for three months. In prison, they wanted me to sign a document saying I’d refused to take the therapy, but I wouldn’t sign. After three months, my mother helped. She went to my doctor and made sure I could access my medicine.The biggest thing was the depression. I felt really depressed, really weak. I just wanted to lie on my bed all day and do nothing. I didn’t really want to eat. Sometimes I drank coffee. I was just waiting for evening when I would call my mother and nephew, to hear their voices.Calls were not officially allowed, but if you knew people and had money for bribes, then you could buy a phone and hide it.In our cell, we had one phone for the six of us. The girls would hide it in places where the guards wouldn’t find it, like in the floor. They’d dig a hole and then cover it.I was treated differently as a non-separatist.There were extra security measures for me, and even in the cell when I was talking about my views, I had to be careful.For example, once I said that the checkpoint was not the real border of a real country.Others told me, “Just shut your mouth, or you’ll get more serious charges.” Word of my views spread, and police officers told my lawyer to tell me to be silent.The food was bad: porridge, pasta and thin, meatless soups. You couldn’t really eat what they gave you. It just wasn’t possible, so we mostly ate what our family members brought us. I lost 7kg [15 pounds] due to the stress.I had the impression that the trial was a formality.Throughout the whole trial, the prosecutor was just looking at her phone. It seemed like they knew their decision from the very beginning. The first court hearing was in March, four months after my arrest. In total, I spent two years and seven months waiting for the verdict.The day they handed down the verdict, I knew that they’d already decided I was guilty. The night before was a nightmare, anticipating the final decision. They announced that I got 11 years.I just couldn’t understand it. Even murderers get less.After the sentencing, I was taken to the correctional colony.Officially, it wasn’t a labour colony, but we had to work all day long, irrespective of the weather, even when it was raining or snowing. The work was mainly maintaining the colony: to clean everything, paint, put things in order, do the maintenance, things like that.Once a week, we had the so-called banya.There was no shower, but there was an area with hot water and cold water and we could either clean ourselves using these big vessels, or we could do the laundry. There were no laundry machines. We had to do our laundry with our hands.There was coal heating, which was okay when heating was working, but sometimes the equipment was broken. Then it was cold, and we would have to put our warmest clothes and coats on to sleep.They reminded us all the time that we were prisoners. There was verbal abuse, bad words used to humiliate people.I hoped to be exchanged before a full-scale invasion happened. Then, after the invasion, I thought, “Now it’s war, and people have bigger concerns than exchanging us,” and I lost hope.So the exchange was very unexpected and joyful for me.The head of the correctional colony called me in and told me I was pardoned, which I thought was strange because I hadn’t signed anything. Around 9pm, I was brought to another prison. They put a bag on my head.I asked, “Is this the way they pardon people in the DPR?”A guard said, “Shut your mouth, or we will shoot you here.”And I replied, “If that’s a joke, it’s not a funny joke.”Then they took my hand and led me to some kind of underground room. But I realised that since they didn’t want me to see anything, it must be an exchange, and I was happy and ready to go through anything to get back to my homeland.The next day, they put different bags on our heads and adhesive so we couldn’t see anything and taped our hands together. We remained that way on the bus and plane.Now I’m back to work in harm reduction. I send a big thank you to my colleagues and to the government of Ukraine.The fact that they didn’t leave me there shows that they care about all the people of Ukraine, including OST programme clients and people living with HIV.We are all important.",-0.00351,0.4607,8125,6,4,6,0,0

Russian forces also tried to advance near Lyman, a town further north that was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in October, the military said.Russia was reaching further west in Donetsk by firing on the town of Vuhledar and a half dozen other towns and villages, the Ukraine military said. Vuhledar is about 148km (90 miles) from the main fighting in and around Bakhmut.In an unusually detailed intelligence update, the British defence ministry said Russian forces had advanced hundreds of metres across a river towards Vuhledar and could make more localised gains there. It said the assault was unlikely to lead to a significant breakthrough but could be intended to draw Ukrainian efforts away from defending Bakhmut.Military aid, diplomacyThe United States accused Russia of violating the New START treaty, the last major pillar of post-Cold War nuclear arms control between the two countries, saying Moscow was refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government is lobbying hard for allies to supply fighter jets that it can use to repulse Russian advances. French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said “there was no taboo” about supplying Kyiv with fighter planes, following a meeting with Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov in Paris.The US is readying more than $2bn in military aid for Ukraine that is expected to include longer-range rockets for the first time, as well as other munitions and weapons, according to the Reuters news agency, citing two US officials briefed on the plan.Human Rights Watch has said Ukraine should investigate its troops’ use of banned antipersonnel landmines which caused civilian casualties in Izyum when the area was under Russian occupation.",0.03663,0.29061,2366,4,2,9,0,1
134,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/us-readying-new-2-billion-ukraine-weapons-package-report,"The United States is readying more than $2bn worth of military aid for Ukraine that is expected to include longer-range rockets for the first time as well as other munitions and weapons, according to the Reuters news agency, citing two US officials briefed on the plan.The aid is expected to be announced as soon as this week, the officials said on Wednesday. It is also expected to include support equipment for Patriot air defence systems, precision-guided munitions and Javelin anti-tank weapons, they added.One of the officials said a portion of the package, expected to be $1.725bn, would come from a fund known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which allows President Joe Biden’s administration to get weapons from industry rather than from US weapons stocks.The USAI funds would go towards the purchase of a new weapon, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), which has a range of 150km (94 miles). The US has rebuffed Ukraine’s requests for the 300-km (185-mile) range ATACMS missile.The longer range of the GLSDB glide bomb could allow Ukraine to hit targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russia further behind its lines.The GLSDB is GPS-guided, can defeat some electronic jamming, is usable in all weather conditions, and can be used against armoured vehicles, according to SAAB, the Swedish-based company which produces the weapon with Boeing.The GBU-39 bomb, which would function as the GLSDB’s warhead, has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km (60 miles) if dropped from an aircraft and hit targets as small as 1 metre (3 feet) in diameter.The USAI funds would also be used to pay for more components of HAWK air defences, counter-drone systems, counter artillery and air surveillance radars, communications equipment, PUMA drones, and spare parts for major systems like Patriots and Bradleys, one of the officials said.There was also a significant amount of medical equipment — enough to equip three field hospitals — being donated by another ally, the official added.The White House declined to comment. The contents and size of aid packages can change up until they are signed by the president.In addition to the USAI funds, more than $400m worth of aid was expected to come from Presidential Drawdown Authority funds, which allows the president to take from current US stocks in an emergency.That aid was expected to include mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs), guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) and ammunition.The US has sent security assistance worth approximately $27.2bn to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on February 24 last year. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05018,0.3542,3454,5,2,3,0,0

The Ukrainian army in Bakhmut is supplied with everything necessary,” he said.Russian forces have made several advances in the area in recent weeks, notably capturing the salt-mining town of Soledar to Bakhmut’s north.Earlier this month, Russia also claimed it had captured Klishchiivka, a village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, which had a pre-war population of about 400 people. The village sits about nine kilometres (six miles) south of Bakhmut.This week, a large Russian force launched an assault against the Ukrainian-held bastion of Vuhledar, further south along the same eastern front. Russian officials have claimed to have gained a foothold there, but Kyiv says it has largely repelled that attack so far.Military centres in BelarusMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday backed a plan to set up joint military training centres with Belarus, reigniting speculation that forces from the neighbouring country could join his troops in Ukraine.In a decree, Putin tasked the defence and foreign ministers to conduct talks with Belarus and sign an agreement to establish the facilities.The document did not specify where the centres would be based. Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory as a launching pad for its Ukraine offensive that began on February 24 last year.For months, Belarus’s longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko has insisted that he will not send troops into Ukraine despite increasing military cooperation with Russia.Ukrainian servicemen attend joint drills of armed forces, national guards, border guards and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) at the border with Belarus [File: Gleb Garanich/Reuters]Earlier this month, the two countries launched joint air force drills in Belarus that are scheduled to last until February 1.“Some experts say the exercises could be a diversion tactic to lure Ukrainian forces away from the frontlines in the east and south,” said Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from near the Ukraine-Belarus border, where Ukrainian forces have been training amid a potential threat military threat from Belarus.“Few people here expected this war and no one pretends they know what Moscow is planning. But they are watching closely and say they are ready.”France to send more weaponsSeparately, defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Tuesday that France will send 12 further Caesar truck-mounted howitzers to Ukraine to help in the fight against Russia.The artillery pieces, adding to 18 already delivered, would be financed from a 200-million-euro ($217m) fund set up by France after Russia’s invasion, Lecornu said in a joint news conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksiy Reznikov, in Paris.Alongside other Western-supplied mobile cannon such as the German Panzerhaubitze 2000, the Caesar was credited last year with helping Ukraine attack targets deep behind Russian lines, undermining Moscow’s offensive.The truck-mounted 155mm guns can set up, fire a highly-accurate volley at ranges of up to 40km (25 miles) and shift position before the enemy can locate them and fire back.Lecornu said the new batch of howitzers would be delivered in the coming weeks.Denmark has also pledged its entire existing 19-strong fleet of the French-made howitzers to the Ukrainian war effort.",0.01394,0.29489,4679,12,4,17,2,0
136,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/31/natos-stoltenberg-calls-for-stronger-partnership-with,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the Western military alliance will continue to strengthen its partnership with Japan, adding that “our security is closely interconnected” as Russia’s war on Ukraine raises global dangers.Arriving in Tokyo from South Korea on Monday where he had urged Seoul to increase its military support for Ukraine, Stoltenberg said his trip was aimed at strengthening relations between NATO and “our highly valued partner” Japan.“The war in Ukraine also demonstrates that our security is closely interconnected,” Stoltenberg said on Tuesday during a visit at the Iruma Air Base north of Tokyo.“If President [Vladimir] Putin wins in Ukraine it will be a tragedy for the Ukrainians, but it will also send a very dangerous message to authoritarian leaders all over the world because then the message will be that when they use military force they can achieve their goals,” he said.“The war in Ukraine matters for all of us, and therefore we’re also very grateful for the support that Japan is providing, using also the planes and the cargo capabilities,” Stoltenberg added.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has sounded alarm that Russia’s aggression in Europe could happen in Asia, where concerns are growing over China’s escalating tension with Taiwan as well as threats from North Korea.Already a close ally of the United States, Japan has in recent years expanded its military ties with other Indo-Pacific nations as well as the United Kingdom, Europe and NATO. Japan was also quick to join the US-led economic sanctions against Russia, and the country has also provided humanitarian aid and non-combative defence equipment for the Ukrainians.In a crucial break from its post-World War II principle that limited Japan to self-defence, Tokyo unveiled a new national security strategy in December that will see a large increase in its military capabilities, including the deployment of long-range missiles to preempt enemy attacks. Japan also hopes to further ease restrictions on arms export to strengthen the country’s feeble defence industry.Stoltenberg is set to meet Kishida and hold a joint news conference later on Tuesday.While in South Korea on Monday, Stoltenberg called for Seoul to provide direct military support to Ukraine. So far, Seoul has provided humanitarian aid and other support, citing a longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries in conflict.Stoltenberg discussed with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol NATO’s possible role in dissuading North Korea from its growing nuclear ambitions following an unprecedented number of ballistic missile tests in 2022, Yoon’s office said. Stoltenberg also mentioned US intelligence reports accusing North Korea of providing weapons to Russia to support its war in Ukraine.North Korea has condemned Stoltenberg’s visits to South Korea and Japan, saying NATO was trying to put its “military boots in the region” and attempting to pressure the US’s Asian allies into providing weapons to Kyiv.Pyongyang has criticised increasing cooperation between NATO and US allies in Asia as a process to create an “Asian version of NATO”.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.02164,0.35808,3857,7,5,4,1,0

138,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/30/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-russias-big-revenge-has-begun,"Russia has begun its “big revenge” for Ukraine’s resistance to its invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, as Russian forces claimed a series of incremental gains in his country’s east.Zelenskyy has been warning for weeks that Moscow aims to step up its assault on Ukraine after about two months of virtual stalemate along the front line that stretches across the south and east.While there was no sign of a broader new offensive on Monday, the administrator of Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, Denis Pushilin, said Russian troops had secured a foothold in Vuhledar, a coal mining town whose ruins have been a Ukrainian bastion since the outset of the war.Pushilin’s adviser, Yan Gagin, said fighters from Russian mercenary force Wagner had taken partial control of a supply road leading to Bakhmut, a city that has been the focus of a Russian offensive for months.A day earlier, the head of Wagner said his fighters had secured Blahodatne, a village just north of Bakhmut.Kyiv said it had repelled assaults on Blahodatne and Vuhledar. The Reuters news agency could not independently verify the situations there, but the locations of the reported fighting indicated clear, though gradual, Russian gains.Zelenskyy said Russian attacks in the east were relentless despite heavy casualties on the Russian side, casting them as payback for Ukraine’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the capital, northeast and south earlier in the conflict.“I think that Russia really wants its big revenge. I think they have [already] started it,” Zelenskyy said.“Every day they either bring in more of their regular troops, or we see an increase in the number of Wagnerites,” he told reporters in Ukraine’s southern port city of Odesa.Vuhledar sits south of Bakhmut, near where the eastern front line protects Russian-controlled rail lines supplying Moscow’s forces in southern Ukraine. Mykola Salamakha, a Ukrainian colonel and military analyst, told Ukrainian Radio NV that Moscow’s assault there was coming at a huge cost.“The town is on an upland and an extremely strong defensive hub has been created there,” he said. “This is a repetition of the situation in Bakhmut — one wave of Russian troops after another crushed by the Ukrainian armed forces.”Weapons deliveries months awayIn recent weeks, Western countries have pledged hundreds of modern tanks and armoured vehicles to equip Ukrainian forces for an offensive to recapture territory later in 2023.But the delivery of those weapons is months away, leaving Kyiv to fight on through the winter in what both sides have described as a meat grinder of relentless attritional warfare.Moscow’s Wagner mercenary force has sent thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons into battle around Bakhmut, buying time for Russia’s regular military to reconstitute units with hundreds of thousands of reservists.Zelenskyy is urging the West to hasten delivery of its promised weapons so Ukraine can go on the offensive.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Western countries supplying arms leads “to NATO countries more and more becoming directly involved in the conflict — but it doesn’t have the potential to change the course of events and will not do so”.The US-based Institute for the Study of War think tank said “the West’s failure to provide the necessary materiel” last year was the main reason Kyiv’s advances had halted since November.That had allowed Russia to apply pressure at Bakhmut and fortify the front against a future Ukrainian counterattack, its researchers said in a report, though they said Ukraine could still recapture territory once the promised weapons arrive.Zelenskyy met Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday in Mykolaiv, a rare visit by a foreign leader close to the front. The city, where Russia’s advance in the south was halted, had been under relentless bombardment until Ukraine pushed the front line back in November.Zelenskyy’s office released footage of the president greeting Frederiksen with a handshake on a snowy street before entering a hospital where they met wounded soldiers.Iran raidWhile Kyiv has secured weapons from the West, Moscow has turned to allies, including Iran, which Kyiv and the West say has provided Russia with hundreds of long-range so-called “suicide drones” used to attack Ukrainian cities.Over the weekend, an Iranian military factory was hit by a drone attack that a US official said appeared to have been carried out by Israel. Israel has not commented.Kyiv implied that the attack on Iran was payback for Tehran’s military support for Russia: “Explosive night in Iran,” senior Zelenskyy aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted. “Did warn you.”Iran summoned the charge d’affaires at Ukraine’s embassy over Podolyak’s remarks. Russia said the raid on Iran “could have unpredictable consequences for peace and stability in the Middle East”.Unlike many Western countries, Israel has stopped short of openly arming Kyiv, but it is seen as alarmed by Russia’s reliance on Iranian drone technology it views as a regional security threat.Ukraine, which has received large supplies of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) from its partners, said it planned to spend nearly $550m on drones this year, with 16 supply deals signed with Ukrainian manufacturers.France, meanwhile, said it had agreed with Australia to cooperate to manufacture “several thousand” shells for Ukraine.Russia’s invasion, which it launched on February 24 last year claiming it was necessary to protect itself from its neighbour’s ties with the West, has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05062,0.25679,6374,12,5,22,0,8

Disintegration of Russia, change of the government? There is also talk of tearing Russia apart. This is mad,” he said.“It is clear that Crimea will never again be part of Ukraine,” Milanovic added.The Croatian president was elected in 2019 as a left-leaning liberal candidate, a counterpoint to the conservative government currently in power in the European Union and NATO-member state.But he has since made a turn to populist nationalism and criticised Western policies towards Russia as well as the Balkans.Milanovic has built a reputation for being pro-Russia, which he has repeatedly denied.Yet in recent months, he has openly opposed the admission of Finland and Sweden into NATO as well as the training of Ukrainian troops in Croatia as part of EU aid to the embattled country.After months of hesitation, the United States said last week that it would send 31 of the 70-tonne Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, and Germany announced it will dispatch 14 Leopard 2 tanks and allow other countries to do the same.Milanovic said that “from 2014 to 2022, we are watching how someone provokes Russia with the intention of starting this war”.“What is the goal of this war? A war against a nuclear power that is at war in another country? Is there a conventional way to defeat such a country?” Milanovic asked on Monday.“Who pays the price? Europe. America pays the least,” he said. “A year has passed and we are only now talking about tanks,” Milanovic said.“Not a single American tank will go to Ukraine in a year. Only German tanks will be sent there.”Although the presidential post is mostly ceremonial in Croatia, Milanovic is formally the supreme commander of the armed forces.His latest anti-Western outbursts have embarrassed and irritated the country’s government, which has fully supported Ukraine.Source: APAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.05517,0.38604,2967,5,8,7,0,0

State media carried footage that showed the remains of the drones, with one seemingly caught in a mesh net installed on top of the plant as a defence measure.The Wall Street Journal on Sunday cited unnamed United States officials and people familiar with the strike as saying Israel was behind the drone attack. Israel has not officially commented.On the night of the drone attack, there were several other incidents in other regions of Iran, including a fire at a major industrial complex in the northwest of the country. Authorities have not officially linked the incidents.Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Sunday criticised the drone attack as “cowardly”, saying it was aimed at jeopardising the security of the country.Iran has so far not officially blamed Israel for the attack, but it has previously been a target of many suspected Israeli strikes amid a shadow war with its arch foe. Israel has threatened large-scale strikes as efforts to restore Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers remain deadlocked.Meanwhile, Ukraine and Western countries have repeatedly accused Iran of supplying Russia with attack drones that have been used in the war in Ukraine, and they have imposed several rounds of sanctions on it. Iran has acknowledged supplying a “limited” number of drones to Russia but said this was before the start of the war in February last year.",0.01159,0.33546,2656,4,9,2,0,1
141,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/30/uks-johnson-says-putin-threatened-him-with-missile-strike,"Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened him with a missile attack during a phone call in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine, in an allegation the Kremlin has refused.Johnson, speaking to the BBC for a documentary to be broadcast later on Monday, said the Russian leader had asked him about the prospects of Ukraine joining NATO, to which he had responded it would not be “for the foreseeable future”.“He threatened me at one point, and he said, ‘Boris, I don’t want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute,’ or something like that,” Johnson said, recalling the “very long” and “most extraordinary” call in February 2022 which followed a visit by the then-prime minister to Kyiv.“But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.”Russia denies Johnson’s account.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were “no threats” of missiles in the exchange.“It is either a deliberate lie – so you have to ask Mr. Johnson why he chose to put it that way – or it was an unconscious lie and he did not in fact understand what Putin was talking to him about,” he told reporters.Peskov argued that Putin had in fact explained to Johnson how, if Ukraine joined NATO, US or NATO weapons placed near Russia’s borders would mean a missile could reach Moscow in a matter of minutes.“If that’s how this passage was understood, then it’s a very awkward situation,” Peskov said, as he suggested that there may have been a misunderstanding.A staunch supporter of UkraineAs the war dragged on after February 24 last year, Johnson emerged as one of the most impassioned Western backers of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.But prior to the invasion, he says he was at pains to tell Putin that there was no imminent prospect of Ukraine joining NATO while warning him that any invasion would mean “more NATO, not less NATO” on Russia’s borders.“He said, ‘Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join NATO any time soon.“‘What is any time soon?’ And I said: ‘Well it’s not going to join NATO for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectly well.'”The BBC documentary charts the growing divide between the Russian leader and the West in the years before the invasion of Ukraine.It also features Zelenskyy reflecting on his thwarted ambitions to join NATO prior to Russia’s attack.“If you know that tomorrow Russia will occupy Ukraine, why don’t you give me something today I can stop it with?” the Ukrainian leader says. “Or if you can’t give it to me, then stop it yourself.”In the years before the war began, relations between Moscow and London had sunk to their lowest level in decades, on the back of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the British city of Salisbury in 2018.Johnson, who stepped down in September in the wake of a series of scandals, sought to position London as Kyiv’s top ally in the West.While in office, he visited Kyiv several times, called Zelenskyy frequently, and was beloved by Ukrainians.Last week, he made another surprise visit to show his continued solidarity.“The sooner Putin fails, the better for Ukraine and for the whole world,” he said in a statement.",0.07926,0.30172,3308,9,5,9,5,3

Blahodatne is under our control,” Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said.There was no immediate confirmation from Russia’s defence ministry.Russian troops have increased their attacks in the east of Ukraine, particularly on the towns of Vuhledar and Bakhmut. Moscow’s primary goal is to capture the eastern Donetsk region that it already declared part of Russia.Ukraine is facing a “very tough” situation in the east and needs faster weapons supplies and new types of weaponry to withstand Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday.“The situation is very tough. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other sectors in Donetsk region – there are constant Russian attacks,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.“Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We have to speed up events, speed up supplies and open up new weapons options for Ukraine.”Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, reported at least three people were killed on Sunday after Russian shelling of residential areas in the southern city of Kherson.According to the administration, the artillery barrage killed two men and a woman, and six others were wounded.Civilian facilities were damaged, including a hospital, school, bus station, post office, bank and residential buildings.While the front in southern Ukraine has been considerably quieter recently than in the east – especially since Moscow withdrew from Kherson city in November last year – the city is still subject to frequent Russian shelling.Russian-backed authorities said on Sunday that four people were killed and five wounded after Ukrainian forces attacked a bridge in southeastern Ukraine’s Melitopol district.Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, said a rocket was launched from a high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS) at a railway bridge across the Molochna River in Melitopol.“At this time, renovation work was under way at the facility. According to preliminary data, as a result of the shelling, four people from the railway brigade were killed, five were injured, they are receiving the necessary medical care,” he wrote on Telegram.Moscow also declared the Zaporizhia region, which includes Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, part of Russia but does not fully control the entire territory.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.0324,0.28606,3502,7,1,12,0,2

Zelenskyy specifically mentioned the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).“There can be no taboo in the supply of weapons to protect against Russian terror,” said Ukraine’s leader.Russia last week condemned the delivery of NATO battle tanks to Ukraine, calling it “direct and growing” evidence of United States and European involvement in the war.‘Keep talking’ with PutinThe German leader also said he will continue to phone Russian President Vladimir Putin, stressing the importance of maintaining an open channel of communication in order to find an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine.Scholz said the tone of the conversations was “not impolite, but our perspectives are of course completely different”.“And I will continue to phone Putin — because we have to keep talking to each other,” he said.The last phone call to Putin was at the start of December. The Russian leader said at the time that the German and Western line on Ukraine was “destructive” and called on Berlin to rethink its approach.The conversations, Scholz said, were often about “concrete issues” such as prisoner exchanges, Ukrainian grain exports, and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.“For me it’s important that the conversations keep coming back to the main point: how does the world get out of this terrible situation? The condition for that is clear: the withdrawal of Russian troops,” Scholz said in the interview.No ‘escalation’Scholz also warned that NATO should not be dragged into a war with Moscow.“A German chancellor who takes his oath of office seriously must do everything to ensure that Russia’s war against Ukraine does not turn into a war between Russia and NATO,” he stressed, adding he will not “allow such an escalation”.The Leopard 2 announcement, followed shortly afterwards by a US pledge of M1 Abrams tanks to Kyiv, infuriated the Kremlin.“For now, there are no agreed talks [with Scholz] in the schedule. Putin has been and remains open to contacts,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.Germany is the second-largest donor of military hardware to Ukraine after the US, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, ahead of other European powers such as France and Britain.",0.01038,0.31024,3662,10,10,9,5,2

His colleague Chris Parry, 28, was also killed during heavy fighting.Several dozen people gathered to mourn Bagshaw, who was in his late 40s, including fellow volunteers who knew him and others who came to express condolences. A small church linked to Kyiv’s ancient St Sophia Cathedral was packed for the service, which was led by an Orthodox priest.“I remember one of the first times when we went [on an evacuation run] together. He was a very quiet person; he just wanted to help people,” said volunteer Ignatius Ivlev-Yorke, who organised Bagshaw’s memorial service.“He felt that this was his mission. That he had a duty to do it.”Volunteers and other mourners attend a memorial service for Andrew Bagshaw in Kyiv [Gleb Garanich/Reuters]Bagshaw’s family said the volunteers were killed while trying to rescue an elderly woman from the town when their cars were hit by a shell, according to Sky News.Ukrainian police said on January 9 that they lost contact with Bagshaw and Perry after the two men left Kramatorsk for Soledar on January 6.Parry’s family confirmed in a statement released through the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office that both men had been killed on Tuesday. However, the statement gave no details on the circumstances of their deaths.According to Parry’s family, he “found himself drawn to Ukraine in March in its darkest hour at the start of the Russian invasion and helped those most in need, saving over 400 lives plus many abandoned animals”.The UK’s Foreign Office said it was supporting the families. Bagshaw was also a dual citizen of New Zealand, where he was living when he travelled to Ukraine in April.On Wednesday, Ukraine acknowledged for the first time that it had retreated from Soledar, almost two weeks after Russian troops said they captured the small salt-mining town.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00371,0.26987,2895,4,0,3,0,0

148,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/29/north-korea-denies-arming-russias-wagner-group,"North Korea has denied providing arms to Russia after the United States accused Pyongyang of supplying rockets and missiles to the Russian Wagner Group and helping bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine.A senior North Korean official, in a statement on Sunday, slammed the US allegations as a “groundless rumour” aimed at justifying Washington’s own military aid to Ukraine.The US had designated Wagner as a “transnational criminal organisation” earlier this month, citing the private military group’s alleged weapons dealings with North Korea – something that is prohibited by United Nations Security Council resolutions.The White House also showed what it said were US intelligence photographs of Russian rail cars entering North Korea, picking up a load of infantry rockets and missiles, and returning to Russia.But the director general of the North Korean Department of US Affairs, Kwon Jong Gun, rejected the accusations on Sunday, warning that the US will face a “really undesirable result” if it persists in spreading the “self-made rumour”.“Trying to tarnish the image of [North Korea] by fabricating a non-existent thing is a grave provocation that can never be allowed and that cannot but trigger its reaction,” Kwon Jong Gun said.He added that the US move was “a foolish attempt to justify its offer of weapons to Ukraine”.Earlier this week, US President Joe Biden promised 31 Abrams tanks, one of the US army’s most powerful and sophisticated weapons, to help Kyiv fight off Moscow’s invasion.The move drew a rebuke Friday from Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who accused Washington of “further crossing the red line” by sending the tanks into Ukraine.Kwon Jong Gun reiterated Pyongyang’s concerns over the tank transfer on Sunday, calling it an “unethical crime” aimed at perpetuating an unstable international situation.Along with China, Russia is one of North Korea’s few international friends.Russia, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, has long held the line against increasing pressure on nuclear-armed North Korea, even asking for relief from international sanctions for humanitarian reasons.Meanwhile, other than Syria and Russia, North Korea is the only country to recognise the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk, two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.In November, after the White House said Pyongyang was covertly supplying Russia with a “significant” number of artillery shells, North Korea said it had never had arms dealings with Russia and had no plans to do so.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.06034,0.35661,3289,5,1,10,0,0

Russia denies targeting civilians.‘Yet another crime’Meanwhile, three people were killed and more than a dozen others wounded following a Russian attack on the city of Konstantynivka in eastern Ukraine, the local governor said on Saturday.“The Russians fired at a residential neighbourhood, damaged four multi-story buildings, a hotel, garages and civilian cars,” Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on social media.Kyrylenko said rescue workers and police were at the scene, “helping people and carefully documenting yet another crime by the Russian occupiers on our land”.Images posted on Kyrylenko’s Telegram account showed apartment buildings with blown-out windows and debris scattered around the charred remains of a car.According to Ukraine’s defence ministry, Russia carried out attacks on Konstantynivka with multiple rocket launchers.Almost a year into its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow is seeking to seize control of the entire Donetsk region, which it has already declared a part of Russia.‘Deliberately destroying towns’Ukraine said last week Russian troops stepped up their attacks in the east, particularly on the towns of Vugledar and Bakhmut.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the battles near Bakhmut and Vuhledar, 200km (90 miles) to the south, as “extremely acute”.“The occupiers are not just storming our positions, they are deliberately and methodically destroying these towns and villages around them,” he said.Ukrainian troops are battling Russian soldiers for control of Vuhledar along the southern front. Both sides claimed success in the small administrative centre of apartment blocks surrounded by flat fields.“The encirclement and subsequent liberation of this city solves many problems,” said Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed leader of the Donetsk region.But Kyiv said the town, which had a pre-invasion population of about 15,000, remained contested. “There is fierce combat there,” Ukrainian military spokesman Sergiy Cherevaty told local media.‘Decisive strategic action’Bloomberg News reported that Russia was seeking to demonstrate that its military can change the momentum of the war after months of battlefield setbacks by launching a full-out offensive.It quoted unnamed Russian officials and advisers as saying the goal is to achieve rapid victories to gain control of the eastern regions that were annexed last year to strengthen Moscow’s hand at any future peace talks.The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank agreed with the reporting.“This report is consistent with ISW’s current assessment and forecast that the Kremlin is likely preparing to conduct a decisive strategic action – most likely in Luhansk Oblast – in the next six months intended to regain the initiative and end Ukraine’s current string of operational successes,” it said.“ISW previously assessed that the decisive strategic action in Luhansk Oblast could be either a major offensive or a Russian defensive operation to defeat and exploit a Ukrainian counteroffensive.”One Ukraine official said it is possible Russia will time its major offensive near the anniversary of the start of the war last year.“It is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by February 24,” Oleksiy Danilov, head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told Radio Liberty on Friday.The aim is to seize the entire Donbas – Donetsk and Luhansk – and then “to completely go beyond the borders of the regions”, said Danilov.",0.03494,0.24669,4531,10,6,17,0,1

So that he could see with his own eyes that neutrality does not exist. pic.twitter.com/icSdvgpD87— Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) January 27, 2023 Bach said on Friday that Russian and Belarusian athletes could hope to compete at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, but only if they compete under a neutral flag.The mission is to bring together athletes from all over the world, “especially when their countries are in conflict,” Bach said during a press briefing in the German town of Oberhof.“The principle that has been laid down is: No Russian or Belarusian athletes,” Bach explained, but “individual, neutral athletes from these countries without any identification with their nationality” could “possibly” compete next year.However, he stressed that the IOC is just “at the beginning of very detailed consultations” on the matter.Russian forces have been trying to take control of Bakhmut for months in what Kyiv has described as some of the bloodiest battles since the start of Russia’s offensive on February 24 last year.Zelenskyy said “it is impossible not to be disappointed” by the stance of the IOC chief.“I spoke with him more than once and never heard how he was going to protect sports from war propaganda if he returned Russian athletes to international competitions,” Zelenskyy said.“We will do everything for the world to protect sport from the political and any other influence of a terrorist state, which is simply inevitable if Russian athletes compete.”In a statement on Wednesday, the IOC said that its executive board met to consider the issue, and “the vast majority of the participants” had expressed that “no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport” and that “governments must not decide which athletes can participate in which competition and which athletes cannot”.Statement on solidarity with Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Belarus, and the status of athletes from these countries👇 https://t.co/OGk1HqoN1N— IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) January 25, 2023Ukrainian Sports Minister Vadym Gutzeit has informed the IOC that his country is planning to boycott the 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete.“There can’t be agreements with representatives of terrorist countries,” Gutzeit said.“I hope that all federations, athletes and the whole world have been paying close attention and that we don’t have to resort to this extreme means,” Gutzeit warned, referring to an Olympic boycott by Ukraine.Bach said on Friday that excluding athletes solely on the basis of their passport does not meet human rights requirements. If exceptions were made and athletes holding a Russian or Belarusian passport were excluded from the Olympic Games, this would create “an enormously dangerous precedent for world sport,” Bach argued, adding that other countries were also affected by wars.“What do you say to an athlete from Yemen, from Iraq, from Libya, from Armenia, from Azerbaijan, from Ethiopia?”The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) on Thursday offered Russian and Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in this year’s Asian Games.",-0.01577,0.39312,4180,5,3,15,0,6

The US announcement followed Germany’s decision to also provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks from its own stocks.NEW: Kim Jong Un’s sister slammed the U.S. for sending tanks to Ukraine.In a statement published by KCNA on Friday, Kim Yo Jong criticized Washington for “crossing the line” and exposing Europe to “grave danger.”https://t.co/9rIi0HWRSj— NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) January 28, 2023Kim said US President Joe Biden’s administration was “further crossing the red line” by sending its main tanks to Ukraine and that the decision reflects a “sinister intention to realize its hegemonic aim by further expanding the proxy war for destroying Russia”.North Korea has blamed the US for the crisis in Ukraine, insisting that the West’s “hegemonic policy” forced Russia to take military action to protect its security interests.North Korea is also the only nation other than Russia and Syria to recognise the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and has also hinted at plans to send workers there to help with rebuilding efforts.The US has accused North Korea of sending large supplies of artillery shells and other ammunition to Russia to support its offensive in Ukraine, although North Korea has repeatedly denied the claim.Pyongyang has also accelerated its weapons development, test-firing more than 70 missiles in 2022 alone, including potentially nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles.(Al Jazeera)",0.01984,0.38667,2946,10,6,10,0,0

Innocent people are dying en masse in Europe, again,” the director Piotr Cywinski said in an address to an audience including Holocaust survivors on Friday.“Wola district in Warsaw, Zamojszczyzna, Oradour and Lidice today are called Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, Mariupol and Donetsk,” he said, referring to places where mass killings took place in World War II and sites where Ukraine and its allies accuse Russian forces of committing atrocities.“Being silent means giving voice to the perpetrators,” Cywinski said. “Remaining indifferent is tantamount to condoning murder,” he said.“Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it.

It is against that evil that our soldiers are bravely fighting,” Putin said.“Forgetting the lessons of history leads to the repetition of terrible tragedies,” he said.During Friday’s commemorations, Holocaust survivors wearing hats and scarves in the blue and white stripes of camp uniforms laid candles on the ruins of a gas chamber.

Others have been permitted to compete under a neutral flag.Just days after Russia launched its offensive on February 24, the IOC had urged sporting governing bodies and organisers to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from international events.But on Wednesday, in an apparent change of course, it said the possibility of athletes from the two countries competing in sporting events as neutrals should be “further explored”.“No athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport,” the IOC said in a statement following a meeting of its executive board.Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia said on Thursday it had offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year’s Asian Games, giving them a qualification pathway for the Paris Games through Asia rather than Europe, where they could face boycotts and hostility.The move was met with dismay and anger in Kyiv.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that Russia should have “no place” in the Olympics.Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also weighed in, urging all “sports figures to make their stance known”.“[The] IOC has been disregarding Russian war crimes, claiming that ‘No athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport’, while Ukrainian athletes continue to be killed by Russia because of their passports,” Kuleba said.‘The wrong path’There was no immediate response from the French government, but other European countries backing Ukraine in the war also criticised the IOC’s decision.British Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said the organisation’s stance was “a world away from the reality of war being felt by the Ukrainian people”.In Germany, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called it “the wrong path”.But in Russia, there was praise for the IOC’s approach from Igor Levitin, an aide to President Vladimir Putin and senior vice president of the Russian Olympic Committee.“I think it is already a success. Olympic society understands that the Olympic Games cannot be staged without Russia,” Levitin was quoted as saying by the state-owned TASS news agency.Meanwhile, the International Paralympic Committee said it would “follow with interest the IOC proposed process”.“We wish to reiterate that we hope and pray that the conflict comes to an end, that no more lives are taken, and that we can run sports and politics separately,” Andrew Parsons, the IPC’s president, said in a statement.The Paris Games are scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11 next year.",-0.03142,0.23041,3917,6,7,15,1,1

Before you provide such information you need to check it and establish that it is not based on rumour,” Russia’s TASS news agency quoted Karchaa as saying.“On the one hand, they want to show that they are doing something useful. On the other, they are again sowing doubt in Western public opinion that somehow Russia cannot cope with upholding nuclear safety,” he said.Karchaa’s acerbic tone was somewhat unusual. Russian officials have sought to ensure Western countries that they are maintaining safety standards and continue to work with the IAEA.In his statement, Grossi said he had discussed the proposed nuclear safety zone around the plant with the European Union in Brussels this week and would have new talks with Moscow.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.10196,0.34955,2597,4,0,7,0,0
158,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/26/russia-nato-war-involvement-growing-with-arms-to-ukraine,"Russia says the delivery of NATO battle tanks to Ukraine is evidence of “direct and growing” US and European involvement in the war, with one analyst suggesting supplying nations could become potential targets.The comments come after the United States and Germany on Wednesday said they would arm Ukraine with dozens of heavy tanks in its fight against Russian forces.“There are constant statements from European capitals and Washington that the sending of various weapons systems to Ukraine, including tanks, in no way signifies the involvement of these countries or the alliance in hostilities in Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.“We categorically disagree with this and, in Moscow, everything the alliance and the capitals I mentioned are doing is seen as direct involvement in the conflict. We see that this is growing.”Kyiv has been seeking hundreds of modern tanks to give its troops the firepower to break Russian defensive lines and reclaim occupied territory in Ukraine’s south and east. Ukraine and Russia have been relying primarily on Soviet-era T-72 tanks.Russia, which launched the war by invading Ukraine on February 24 last year, has increasingly portrayed the conflict as a confrontation with NATO.Sergey Karaganov, a former adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said NATO’s weapons deliveries could result in possible military retaliation against the nations supplying them.“By sending tanks, the NATO countries are becoming more openly involved in the war and that makes them potential targets,” he told Al Jazeera.’25 years of NATO expansion’Karaganov also blamed NATO for starting the conflict in Ukraine.“It is not exactly a Russian-Ukraine war, it is a Russian-Western war. Ukrainians are used as cannon fodder and the leadership is basically marionettes. The West has been advancing and preparing to attack Russia, and Russia decided to strike openly first. But it has been 25 years of NATO expansion.”Despite the vast arms supplies by the West, Karaganov predicted a Russian victory.“Eventually, Russia will destroy Ukraine’s military and the country will be fully de-militarised. The neo-Nazi regime there will be finished,” he said.Game-changer?Experts are divided on how effective Germany’s Leopard 2 and the US Abrams tanks will be against Russian forces.“The deliveries of Leopard 2 will take our ground forces to a qualitatively new level,” said Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.Even though Leopard 2s are heavier than Soviet-designed tanks, they have a strong edge in firepower and survivability.“One Leopard 2 could be equivalent to three or five Russian tanks,” Zhdanov said.But he noted the promised number of Western tanks represents only the minimum Ukraine needs to repel a likely offensive by Moscow, adding that Russia has thousands of heavy armoured vehicles.“Kyiv is preparing for a defensive operation and its outcome will determine the future course of the conflict,” Zhdanov said.Russian military analysts were more sceptical about the NATO tanks, arguing that while Abrams proved clearly superior to older models of Soviet-built ones during the war in Iraq, newer Russian models are more closely matched. They also noted Leopard 2 tanks used by the Turkish army against the Kurds in Syria proved vulnerable to Soviet-era anti-tank weapons.Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads the defence affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, argued both Leopard 2 and Abrams are inferior to Russia’s T-90, a modified version of the T-72.The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has been manufactured only in small numbers and so far has not been used in the war.The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said in its latest intelligence update that Russia has worked to prepare a small batch of T-14s for deployment in Ukraine, but added it had engine and other problems.‘Major policy change’Russian observers, meanwhile, noted it could take a significant time for the Western tanks to reach Ukraine, adding that training Ukrainians to use and properly maintain them would add to the challenge.“It likely means that the Ukrainian military will probably receive a few small batches of tanks that could be incompatible with each other,” Moscow-based defence analyst Ilya Kramnik said in a commentary.Putin, his diplomats and military leaders have repeatedly warned the West that supplying long-range weapons capable of striking deep inside Russia would mark a red line and trigger massive retaliation.Zhdanov argued that by agreeing to arm Ukraine with tanks, the West crossed an important psychological barrier and could eventually provide Kyiv with even more deadly weapons.“Handing over Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine marks a major change in the policy of Western allies who stopped fearing escalation and are now ready to challenge Russia in the war of resources,” Zhdanov said.“The West is forced to more widely open the doors to its military arsenals to Ukraine.”‘Harsh retaliatory action’Ukrainian officials have long expressed hope of getting US F-16 fighter jets and long-range rockets for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, to hit targets far behind the front lines.Such desires drew ominous remarks from Russian diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov, similar to those voiced earlier by Putin and others.“If Washington and NATO give Kyiv weapons to strike peaceful cities deep inside Russia and try to seize the territories that constitutionally belong to Russia, it will force Moscow to take harsh retaliatory action,” Gavrilov told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.“Don’t tell us then that we haven’t warned you.”",0.05439,0.41088,5677,16,10,27,3,0

US and European penalties have also targeted various sectors of the Russian economy and technology and security industries.Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – 11 months ago – after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as Putin demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.Moscow’s war campaign has been mired by military setbacks, as the US and its Western allies continue to provide financial and military support to Kyiv.Russia has vowed to resist the sanctions, accusing the West of prolonging the conflict by arming Ukraine.",-0.04916,0.29394,2941,6,4,13,4,0

He said articles that claimed sources inside the Kremlin wanted to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power, and that a second attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv was being planned, violated Russia’s strict censorship laws.Shortly after invading Ukraine, Russia’s parliament passed legislation outlining jail terms of up to five years for “discrediting” the armed forces and up to 15 years for spreading “deliberately false information” about them.Another independent news site, Mediazona, which reports on the legal system and law enforcement, said on Thursday its publisher Pyotr Verzilov had been accused of spreading “fakes” about the army, motivated by political hatred.Verzilov was charged with violating the law because of social media posts about Bucha, the town near Kyiv where the bodies of hundreds of civilians were found after Russian troops pulled out.Russia’s Investigative Committee said Verzilov “created a real threat of forming a false opinion among citizens about the goals and objectives of the special military operation in Ukraine”, state news agency TASS reported.In a Twitter post on Thursday, Mediazona expressed its solidarity with Meduza, saying Russian authorities have, over the last two years, “constantly threatened journalists and gradually cut them off from their audience”.“We hope that these attempts will fail miserably. We support Meduza unequivocally,” it said.We at Mediazona are naturally care about our colleagues: over the last two years, authorities constantly threatened journalists and gradually cut them off from their audience.We hope that these attempts will fail miserably. We support Meduza unequivocally— Mediazona (@mediazona_en) January 26, 2023Similarly, Novaya Gazeta, another independent Russian newspaper known for its critical coverage of Russian affairs, said in a statement the latest designation is another attempt by the state to “exterminate” a popular outlet.“We are certain that our colleagues are persecuted for their high professional standards in covering Russia’s criminal war against Ukraine,” Novaya Gazeta said.“We stand with Meduza and urge every independent journalist to do the same.”Upon passing the laws in March last year, Russian authorities moved swiftly to block access to dozens of websites – including Meduza’s – and dozens of Russian and international news outlets left the country.Meduza has been based in Latvia since it was established in 2014.

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, said that according to local officials, 20 missiles heading in the direction of the capital were intercepted.“We heard a very loud explosion,” Butler said. “We now know that it was a rocket that hit a non-residential building. We believe it might have been some critical infrastructure.”Odesa’s governor, Maksym Marchenko, said several energy facilities were damaged, causing “significant problems” with the electricity supply.DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy producer, said it was introducing emergency power shutdowns in Kyiv, the surrounding region, and the regions of Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk because of the danger of missile attacks.Other power producers elsewhere in Ukraine also said they were conducting emergency shutdowns.Meanwhile, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukrainian soldiers will start training on how to use Leopard 2 tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles “a little later”. His comment followed Berlin’s announcement on Wednesday that it would send the tanks to Ukraine, ending a weeks-long Western political deadlock.“In any case, the aim with the Leopards is to have the first company in Ukraine by the end of March, beginning of April,” Pistorius said. “I can’t say the precise day.”",0.05226,0.36747,2647,7,2,5,0,0

They have taken part in conflicts from Kosovo to Syria.Both Ukraine and Russia have used Soviet-designed tanks in the current war, which began in February.Kyiv had pleaded for months for Leopards and other Western tanks and armoured vehicles, arguing they could be a game-changer in the worst armed conflict Europe has seen since World War II.Ukraine’s supreme commander, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, reportedly said in December that he needed 300 tanks, 600 to 700 infantry fighting vehicles and 500 Howitzers to push Russian forces back to Ukraine’s pre-war borders.A possible connectionTo an observer with extensive knowledge of both German and Ukrainian politics, there is no coincidence between the firings of Ukrainian officials and Germany’s pledge of tanks.“This explosion [of dismissals] is too sudden and systemic at the same time,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a historian at Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.He said German officials may have given their Ukrainian counterparts an ultimatum during January 20 talks of Ukraine’s allies at the Ramstein military base in Germany.Dozens of nations pledged to boost their military aid to Ukraine at those talks, but Germany said it would withhold the tanks, shocking both Kyiv and Berlin’s allies.“And after that, Ukrainian elites fell to a strong and sudden shake-up provoked by just one [newspaper] story,” Mitrokhin said.Zelenskyy speaks over video link with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin during a meeting of Ukraine’s allies at Ramstein Air Base in Germany [Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/handout via Reuters]“Now everything is different,” Mitrokhin said. “The main owners of tanks and their producer achieved a serious agreement, plus the US that refused to supply tanks for some really unknown reasons is reconsidering its decision.”On Tuesday, Washington also agreed to supply its M1 Abrams tanks and increase the production of heavy artillery shells for them sixfold.The tanks are slightly superior to Leopard 2s but need constant upkeep and typically operate on jet fuel, not diesel like other tanks. Their crews also need extensive training.“And as Germans like to tie together various matters in one big decision, one can’t rule out that the package included elimination of corruption in the military and in humanitarian commissions,” Mitrokhin said.But Ukrainian pundits disagree.“There are two reasons [for the dismissals] – either ineffectiveness or suspected corruption,” Igar Tyshkevych, a Kyiv-based analyst, told Al Jazeera.The former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said the dismissals have nothing to do with the tanks.Once found guilty, the corrupt officials “should face a much tougher punishment. There should be a swift investigation,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko told Al Jazeera.The dismissals were “caused by the need to boost the effectiveness of administration and eliminate ‘corruption spots’ during the war”, Aleksey Kushch, a Kyiv-based analyst, told Al Jazeera.“Especially since there is a demand for it both within the [Ukrainian] public and from Western partners,” he said.Smoke rises in the air after shelling in Odesa, Ukraine [File: Petros Giannakouris/AP]Some Ukrainian servicemen have been cautiously warning that the food sent by Western allies has occasionally been stolen and ended up in civilian stores.“You get a new batch of humanitarian aid and two days later see the same cans with the same logos in a nearby supermarket,” one serviceman told Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity.But the ongoing scandal is by far not Ukraine’s first.Ukroboronprom, a state-run consortium of arms manufacturers that was mired in corruption, is undergoing serious reforms to increase transparency and accountability of its branches.And back in 2019, an investigative report described how the son of then-President Petro Poroshenko’s childhood friend and ally Oleh Hladkovskiy organised a scheme to smuggle used military components from Russia and sell them to Ukraine’s military at double or even triple their price.The scandal led to public protests and tanked Poroshenko’s approval ratings ahead of that year’s presidential vote.Zelenskyy, a popular comedian with no background in politics, won the election, promising to root out corruption.",0.00194,0.38561,6732,14,7,3,0,4

He said he has also spoken to NATO top brass and called for supplies of long-range missiles and high-end aircraft to add to the commitment of tanks by the US and Germany.Germany’s decision paves the way for other countries such as Poland, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway to supply some of their Leopard tanks to Ukraine, going some way towards delivering the hundreds of tanks that Ukraine says it needs.It may take many months for the powerful US tanks that President Joe Biden agreed to send to Ukraine to reach their destination, the White House said.Russia reacted with fury to Germany’s decision to approve the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, saying Berlin was abandoning its “historical responsibility to Russia” arising from Nazi crimes in World War II.FightingThe head of the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said units of the Wagner militia were advancing in the town of Bakhmut and a senior Ukrainian official said fighting there and in a second town was growing fiercer.Ukraine acknowledged its forces had withdrawn from Soledar, a salt-mining town near Bakhmut that Russia said it captured more than a week ago, its biggest gain for more than six months.DiplomacyThe European Court of Human Rights allowed cases brought against Russia by Ukraine and the Netherlands over allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine, and the shooting down of flight MH-17.The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO designated the historic centre of Odesa, on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, a World Heritage in Danger site.Zelenskyy urged a senior UN official to help find a way to resolve what Ukrainian authorities decry as a serious consequence of 11 months of the war – the deportation to Russia of thousands of adults and children.Source: ReutersAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05278,0.37322,2924,9,3,7,0,2

165,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/germany-wavered-before-allowing-leopard-2-tanks-to-ukraine,"It took time, threats and plenty of embarrassment but in the 48th week of the war Germany joined its allies in pledging its prized battle tank to Ukraine to fight the Russians.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday announced Berlin will send a company – about 14 – of the Leopards to Kyiv, and allow other countries owning them to do the same.The tanks are meant to help Ukraine mount a new counteroffensive, or rebuff a renewed Russian offensive – whichever comes first.“Spring and early summer [March-August in Europe] will be decisive in the war. If the big offensive of Russia planned for this time fails, it will be the downfall of Russia and Putin,” said Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief Major-General Vadym Skibitskyi.Even though the number of tanks is far short of what Ukraine requested, Germany consented only after days of pressure from its allies who made it clear Berlin was isolated on the matter.Western governments have generally been careful not to escalate the conflict by providing weapons only as needed.On January 14, the United Kingdom broke the taboo on heavy armour, saying it would send a company of its Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak encouraged other allies to send help. The pressure for tanks fell on Germany because the Leopard is the most mass-produced battle tank in Europe, with some 2,000 spread across 13 countries.But Germany refused to either to send its own tanks, or license others to re-export theirs – a necessary legal step.“Germany does not want to be singled out as the country that has sent the heaviest assault weapons to fight the Russians. This will certainly play into a narrative of a second German invasion into Russia,” said George Pagoulatos, director of the Hellenic Foundation of European and Foreign Policy, a think tank in Athens, referring to the Nazi invasion of Russia during World War II.In part, though, it was the German chancellor’s own governing style that was to blame, said Minna Alander, research fellow at the Finnish Institute on International Relations.“There seems to be this problem that Scholz listens only to his circle of long-term advisers, and in their own echo chamber, it seems they have decided this is the right way – being level-headed, sober-minded, not letting yourself be pushed into anything,” Alander told Al Jazeera.Germany confirms it will supply Ukraine with Leopard 2 battle tanks and approve requests by other countries to do the same.🟠 LIVE updates: https://t.co/f8ew4EPuU8 pic.twitter.com/UeetSYxMrQ— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) January 25, 2023Excuses, excusesSome of Germany’s arguments came across as desperate. At a meeting of the Contact Group on Ukraine in the German city of Ramstein last week, where 50 countries gathered to pledge military aid, German defence minister Boris Pistorius told incredulous allies that he had just ordered an inventory of Leopard stocks to gauge their availability.Business Insider reported his predecessor, Christine Lambrecht, had forbidden such an audit, fearing the mere existence of the document would put pressure on chancellor Scholz to act.But a Spiegel report revealed that inventory of Leopards in the Bundeswehr had been taken in mid-2022, showing at least 19 tanks were immediately available for Ukraine.In addition, German defence contractor Rheinmetall said it could furnish 88 older Leopard 1 tanks in April 2022, a month after Ukraine requested them, and this week Rheinmetall said it could additionally supply 29 newer Leopard 2A4 tanks by April.Ukraine started the war with about 900 battle tanks, according to a RUSI report, but has suffered attrition and now needs hundreds, rather than dozens, of replacements.In an interview with the Economist in December, Ukraine’s top general, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said he needed 300 tanks, 600-700 infantry fighting vehicles, and 500 howitzers to help his forces push back Russian forces.European Council President Charles Michel told Ukraine’s parliament he supported longer-range weapons and tanks from the West.“You need more. More air defence systems, more long-range missiles and ammunition and, most of all, you need tanks. Right now,” Michel said.Germany’s problems complicate Ukraine’s fightGermany has suffered economic damage from the war, said Pagoulatos.“German industrial competitiveness, based on cheap energy imports from Russia and good economic relations with Russia, has … been dealt a terrible blow,” he told Al Jazeera.But the country has also lost a political leadership role in northeastern Europe, whose EU accession it championed and whose economies it helped develop, said Pagoulatos.“This is pretty self-destructive for Germany because it ends up doing what other Europeans are asking it to do … but doing it too late and after being beaten up in the public debate,” Pagoulatos said.After Ramstein, the three Baltic countries’ foreign ministers called on Germany immediately to send tanks to Ukraine – a sign of how far Germany’s standing in Europe has fallen.Poland’s foreign minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he might ignore German re-export licenses and send tanks to Ukraine anyway.“Consent is of secondary importance here, we will either obtain this consent quickly or we will do what is needed ourselves,” he said.A week earlier, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said he planned to build a coalition of those willing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine – effectively usurping Germany’s role.Observers saw venal motives at work. German lawmakers were “giving strategic priority to the long-term relationship with Russia”, wrote Oxford University historian Timothy Garton Ash.St Andrews strategy professor Phillips O’Brien called it “a rather pathetic desire to stay in Russian favour for the post-war world”.Germany may have stuck to its guns at Ramstein, but its resistance unraveled over the weekend, as the Green Party, a junior partner in the governing coalition, distanced itself from Scholz’s Social Democrats.Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock told France’s TV1 that Germany “wouldn’t stand in the way” of other countries sending their Leopard tanks, contradicting Pistorius’ remarks at Ramstein that such requests would have to go through lengthy procedures.Germany had argued at Ramstein it could send one Leopard for every Abrams battle tank sent by the US. Military experts have argued the Abrams is more expensive to run and more difficult to train on.“This seems to have been an original Scholz idea,” said Alander. “The reasoning is it’s a fair deal because Germany depends on the US nuclear umbrella and Germany is much closer to the fight.”The US administration of Joe Biden approved 31 Abrams tanks for Ukraine on Wednesday. But now the Ukrainian army will have to train on three new battle tank designs – the British Challenger, the German Leopard and American Abrams – all in order to reassure Germany it will not suffer from excessive Russian criticism.Momentum to send Ukraine heavy armour began to build in the second half of last year, after it became clear that Ukraine’s armed forces needed it to follow through on their successful counteroffensives in Kherson and Kharkiv – if they were to break through Russian entrenched positions.The European Council on Foreign Relations suggested sending Ukraine 90 tanks, with the EU paying to replace older 2A4 and 2A5 models sent to Ukraine with newer 2A7s. This modernisation could in turn spur Germany to rebuild its largely dishevelled Bundeswehr.A Leopard 2 tank takes part in training in Munster, Lower Saxony [File: Morris Mac Matzen/Reuters]Weapons are flowing to UkraineUkraine also won other significant pledges during the past week.On the eve of the Ramstein meeting, nine EU members met at Tallinn, the Estonian capital, to pledge an “unprecedented set of donations” to Ukraine.“We commit to collectively pursuing delivery of an unprecedented set of donations including main battle tanks, heavy artillery, air defence, ammunition, and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine’s defence,” the countries said in what has been called the Tallinn Declaration.Poland said it would give Ukraine more Soviet T-72 tanks and 42 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles by March, as well as step up training.Denmark said it would send Ukraine 19 self-propelled Cesar howitzers, infantry fighting vehicles, and the Archer artillery system, among others.Sweden earlier announced a $419m package of weapons. The UK would send 600 anti-tank Brimstone missiles.The US pledged a $2.5bn drawdown of weapons including plentiful ammunition, 59 Bradley Fighting Vehicles in addition to the 50 pledged, and 90 Stryker APCs.‘Throwing soldiers like cannonballs’Ukraine will likely need all it can get. Its troops fought fiercely to retake Novoselivske in Luhansk on January 19, and were awaiting reinforcements to press onto neighbouring Kuzemivka. The Ukrainian advance seemed like an attempt to create a salient north of Svatove, from which to encircle the Russian-occupied city.But further south, in Donetsk region, Russian forces pressed forward around Bakhmut, capturing the towns of Soledar and Klishchiivka and threatening lines of communication.“The fall of Bakhmut would have consequences for the entire line of Ukrainian defence. They say that Russia is now throwing soldiers like cannonballs since the losses there do not bother it,” Spiegel quoted a German intelligence report as saying.Ukraine has less manpower to draw on than Russia in these attritional battles. The Ukrainian army is losing a three-digit number of soldiers every day, Germany’s BND intelligence service told a group of Bundestag lawmakers at a secret meeting last week – a reminder that delays in arms delivery are measured in lives lost.",0.05679,0.41127,9727,29,7,18,1,0
166,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/ukraine-eyes-fighter-jets-after-securing-advanced-nato-tanks,"Ukraine says it will now push for Western fourth-generation fighter jets such as the American F-16 after securing dozens of high-end battle tanks from NATO allies.Ukraine won a huge boost for its troops as the United States and Germany announced plans to provide heavy tanks for Kyiv on Wednesday.“The next big hurdle will now be the fighter jets,” said Yuriy Sak, who advises defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov.“If we get them the advantages on the battlefield will be just immense … It’s not just F-16s, fourth-generation aircraft, this is what we want.”Ukraine’s air force has a fleet of ageing Soviet-era fighter jets that came off the assembly line before Kyiv even declared independence more than 31 years ago. The warplanes are used for intercept missions and to attack Russian positions.Western military support has been vital for Kyiv and has rapidly evolved during the war. Before the Russian invasion, even the idea of supplying lethal aid to Ukraine was highly controversial, but Western supplies have since shattered taboo after taboo.“They didn’t want to give us heavy artillery, then they did. They didn’t want to give us HIMARS systems, then they did. They didn’t want to give us tanks, now they’re giving us tanks. Apart from nuclear weapons, there is nothing left that we will not get,” Sak said.Not a chanceGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said there was no chance of fighter jets being sent to Ukraine.“I made it clear very early on that we are not talking about combat aircraft, and I am doing the same here,” he said in the Bundestag.Scholz added, “We will not send ground troops under any circumstances. I have said there will be no direct involvement of NATO soldiers in the Ukraine war. That has not been the case so far and that will not be the case in the future. And everyone can rely on that.”Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia last February, has also said it wants to receive long-range missiles from the West.Moscow reacted furiously on Wednesday after Germany approved the delivery to Ukraine of Leopard 2 tanks, the workhorse of armies across Europe, a decision certain to gird Ukraine’s offensive power.Germany has agreed to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, with the US also expected to confirm the supply of M1 Abrams vehicles. But what’s so vital about tanks?We asked a Ukrainian officer on the front line, to explain ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/yr8otoXpMs— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) January 25, 2023‘Preventing war from escalating’Scholz said Western allies would keep supporting Ukraine, but he also highlighted the danger of further inflaming the conflict.“We must always make it clear in everything we do that we are doing what is necessary and possible to support Ukraine, but that at the same time, we are preventing the war from escalating into a war between Russia and NATO,” Scholz said.Justin Bronk, a researcher at the RUSI think tank in London, said Ukraine’s air force would benefit greatly from NATO fighter jets in terms of air-to-air and potentially air-to-ground lethality.But he said on Twitter they would still be at high risk from Russian surface-to-air missiles, forcing them to fly very low near the front line, something that “would dramatically reduce effective missile range and limit strike options”.A Ukrainian pilot codenamed Juice told Reuters news agency last month many of his peers were taking English lessons in their free time in anticipation that Kyiv would one day receive foreign aircraft, such as the F-16.‘Also need attack helicopters’Last week, allies pledged billions of dollars’ worth of military aid including hundreds of armoured fighting vehicles and troop carriers. Those are seen as more effective for attacking enemy lines when used alongside tanks.Ukraine sees the weapons as restoring its momentum in a war that has lately become a bloody, deadlocked slog.Former Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko told Euronews the next significant weapon system needed from the West is fighter aircraft.“We also need attack helicopters and long-range missiles to reach logistic bases and Russian commanding centres. We should receive these now before Russia attempts its great spring offensive,” Poroshenko said.“The real game changer now is the jet fighter. We should immediately launch training programmes for Ukrainian pilots and prepare to deliver them to Ukraine.”",0.09846,0.39892,4335,16,7,7,0,0

On Wednesday, the Russian embassy in Berlin warned that supplying tanks to Ukraine would lead to a “permanent escalation”.But Biden said that US and European support for Kyiv is defensive in nature.“There is no offensive threat to Russia,” he said. “If Russian troops returned to Russia – where they belong – this war would be over today. That’s what we all want: an end to this war in justice and lasting terms.”Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, said after Biden’s remarks that the US president wanted to calm fears at home of escalation with Russia.“The US president [was] speaking as much to the world as he is to a domestic audience when he said that this is very much about protecting Ukraine … that this is about making sure that Ukrainians are protected and nothing more,” she said.Support for Ukraine in the US Congress has been overwhelming and bipartisan, but some far-right Republicans have been increasingly sceptical of continuing aid to Kyiv.Still, on Wednesday, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed moves by Washington and Berlin to supply Kyiv with tanks.“I was happy to learn yesterday and this morning that – indeed – both the White House and their counterparts in Germany are finally moving forward with these overdue steps,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.",0.07936,0.29964,4279,13,5,12,2,0

The court said a judgment on the merits of the cases will follow at a later date.The cases were filed before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022.“Very good news: the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights is another important step in finding the truth and justice for the victims and their relatives of flight #MH17,” Dutch Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius said in a tweet.Flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam and was bound for Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, as fighting raged between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces, the precursor of the ongoing conflict. All 298 passengers and crew were killed.Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra also welcomed the ruling as a significant milestone in the search for accountability.“We will continue to do everything in our power to achieve justice for all 298 victims of flight #MH17 and their loved ones,” he tweeted.The court said evidence presented at a hearing last year established that from May 11, 2014, areas in eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist rebels were “under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation” and that Moscow “had a significant influence on the separatists’ military strategy”, including providing weapons, carrying out artillery attacks requested by the rebels and giving them political and economic support.Moscow denies any involvement or responsibility for MH17’s downing and in 2014 it also denied any presence in Ukraine.The ECHR said there was enough evidence to establish the admissibility of most of Ukraine’s claims of rights violations and a linked case about the downing of MH17 filed by the Netherlands. It said a small number of allegations were not admissible.The Strasbourg court is an important part of the Council of Europe, which is the continent’s foremost human rights institution. Russia was expelled from the council last year in an unprecedented move over Moscow’s invasion and war in Ukraine. However, the court can still deal with cases against Russia dating from before its expulsion.Marieke de Hoon, assistant professor of international criminal law at the University of Amsterdam, said the EHCR’s statement was “very clear”.“The court today said that it is now beyond unreasonable doubt clear that from April 2014 onwards Russian armed forces, Russian military personnel was active in the Donbas,” she told Al Jazeera, referring to the eastern Ukrainian region. “And also because of that, Russia was under the obligation to guarantee human rights in that area.”The cases in Strasbourg are separate from a criminal prosecution in the Netherlands in which two Russians and a Ukrainian rebel were convicted in absentia in November of multiple murders for their roles in the downing of MH17.In its case at the human rights court, the Netherlands argues that Moscow played a key role in the downing of flight MH17 and argues that Russia’s failure to investigate and lack of cooperation with Dutch prosecutors, along with its denials of involvement, have compounded the suffering of friends and relatives of those killed.Dutch prosecutors say the missile system that downed MH17 was trucked into Ukraine from a military base in Russia and returned there after the shootdown.Ukraine filed cases against Moscow alleging numerous violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, including “unlawful military attacks against civilians which caused many fatalities, including the shooting down of flight MH17, and the summary execution and beating to death of civilians” and soldiers no longer taking part in hostilities. It also accused Russia of abducting 85 Ukrainian children.",0.05248,0.34659,4196,11,2,14,0,0
169,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/which-countries-are-supplying-tanks-to-ukraine,"The United States and Germany have pledged to send state-of-the-art battle tanks to Ukraine, paving the way for several of its European allies to follow suit.The moves, announced by President Joe Biden and Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday, will see Washington deploy 31 Abrams tanks while Berlin will supply Kyiv with 14 German-made Leopard 2 units at first.It comes after the United Kingdom promised to deliver 14 of its own Challenger 2 tanks last week.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has requested 300 tanks to help push back Russia’s invasion forces. Moscow said Western-supplied tanks will “burn” and dismissed suggestions they will impact the outcome of the nearly yearlong conflict.Here’s what we know so far:GermanyAfter days of mounting pressure from Ukrainian and Western officials, the German government on Wednesday overcame its apparent reluctance and announced it would supply Ukraine with the highly sought-after Leopard 2 battle tanks.Scholz said Germany would initially send 14 units and also grant permission for other countries to re-export their stocks of the tanks – removing a major hurdle to additional military support from across Europe.The government said its goal was for Germany and its allies to provide Ukraine with a total of two battalions, or 88 tanks overall.The Leopards, fielded by some 20 armies around the world, are seen as the best option for Ukraine because they are readily available in large numbers and less complex mechanically than other alternatives, such as the M1 Abrams, allowing for quicker training for Ukrainian forces.There are about 2,000 Leopard 2s currently spread across Europe at different levels of readiness, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a British think-tank.United KingdomThe UK has pledged to send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, as well as other advanced artillery support in the coming weeks.The move to boost military support, announced earlier this month, will also see British forces train Ukrainian troops to use the tanks and artillery being supplied.The Challenger 2 has been in service with the British army since 1994. It has been deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq, according to the army.United StatesThe US reversed its previous position and will send 31 of its M1 Abrams battle tank to Ukraine.Biden described the US tanks on Wednesday as “the most capable” in the world, saying that they will help Ukraine defend its territorial integrity.He acknowledged that delivering the tanks to Ukraine will “take time”, but he said Washington will use that time to ensure that Ukrainians are “fully prepared” to integrate the fighting vehicles into their defences.The Abrams tank is considered less suitable for the conflict in Ukraine than the German-made Leopard 2 model because of its heavy fuel consumption and turbine engine, which is highly sophisticated and difficult to maintain.PolandPoland has said it is ready to send 14 of its own reserve of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.The Polish government said on Tuesday that it had formally requested Germany’s permission to do so in line with rules governing the re-export of German military equipment.Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also said his government would ask the European Union for compensation for the cost of the units it wanted to send to Kyiv, calling the move a “test of goodwill”.FinlandFinland’s defence minister said on Wednesday that his country planned to send Leopard 2s to Ukraine following Germany’s move to greenlight re-exports of the tanks.“The international cooperation to send Leopards to Ukraine is advancing now and Finland will participate in that,” Mikko Savola told reporters.It was not immediately clear how many tanks Finland, which shares a border with Russia, planned to supply Ukraine with. Savola said his country’s contribution would be limited in scope due to concerns over its own defences.NorwayNorway will send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine as part of Western military aid.“Norway and the government support the donation of battle tanks to Ukraine. Norway will take part,” Defence Minister Bjorn Arild Gram said in an interview with Norwegian public television NRK, without stating how many would be sent.SpainSpain’s defence minister said her country was open to providing Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks from its own stocks.Margarita Robles told the EFE news agency that the government would act in coordination with other Western allies in helping Ukraine fend off Russia’s invasion.She made no comment on the possible number of tanks Spain may provide.NetherlandsPrime Minister Mark Rutte said the Netherlands was prepared to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine if needed.“If a contribution from the Netherlands helps, we are prepared to do so,” Rutte told Dutch broadcaster RTL.Rutte said the Netherlands could opt to buy tanks it currently leases from Germany, and supply those to Ukraine.",0.08448,0.34198,4955,19,0,3,0,1
170,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/russia-denounces-germany-over-dangerous-tanks-decision,"Moscow has slammed Berlin’s move to supply Ukraine with battle tanks and accused Germany of abandoning its “historical responsibility to Russia” arising from Nazi crimes in World War II.The Russian embassy in Germany said on Wednesday the decision to send 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Kyiv and allow allies to re-export the same models would worsen the war in Ukraine and lead to “permanent escalation”.“This extremely dangerous decision takes the conflict to a new level of confrontation and contradicts the statements of German politicians about the unwillingness of the Federal Republic of Germany to be drawn into it,” Ambassador Sergei Nechayev said.“It destroys the remnants of mutual trust, causes irreparable damage to the already deplorable state of Russian-German relations, and casts doubt on the possibility of their normalisation in the foreseeable future.”Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a post on the Telegram messenger app that the German decision confirmed what she said was a “pre-planned war” against Moscow. Kyiv has for months called for Western tanks, arguing they are desperately needed to give troops firepower and mobility to break through Russian defensive lines and recapture occupied territory in the east and south.Moscow has repeatedly said Western-supplied tanks will “burn” and dismissed suggestions they will affect the outcome of the 11-month conflict, warning they will only prolong Ukrainian suffering.Germany’s move is expected to pave the way for Poland, Finland and a host of other European nations to offer Ukraine tanks from their own stocks of Leopard 2s.“With the approval of the leadership of Germany, battle tanks with German crosses will again be sent to the ‘eastern front’, which will inevitably lead to the deaths of not only Russian soldiers, but also the civilian population,” Nechayev said.The United Kingdom has already pledged to deliver 14 of its Challenger 2 battle tanks to Kyiv, while the United States is poised to reverse course and supply Ukraine with more than 30 of its own M1 Abrams.",0.00345,0.43618,2082,4,4,6,0,0
171,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/abrams-vs-leopard-tanks-why-are-they-important-in-ukraine,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has agreed to send its Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.The news comes amid reports that Washington is also poised to send dozens of M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine’s front lines.Like Germany, the United States had been hesitant.While Berlin was concerned about escalating the war, Washington cited logistical and maintenance challenges Ukrainians may face if they were to receive the Abrams.Both armoured vehicles are considered state-of-the-art and are more powerful than many Soviet-era tanks fielded by both Russian and Ukrainian forces.(Al Jazeera)“The Leopard and American Abrams are actually twins,” Sydney Freedberg, contributing editor of the digital magazine, Breaking Defence, told Al Jazeera.The Leopard 2 was first produced in 1979 by Krauss-Maffei for the German Ministry of Defence.They are in service with the armies of Austria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain and Turkey.(Al Jazeera)The first M1 tank was manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) in 1978 and was delivered to the US Army in 1980.“They are very similar. Big vehicles, heavily armoured. Much better protected than anything the Soviets built, or anything the Russians currently have,” said Freedberg.The main difference between the Abrams and Leopards is the engine.The Leopard 2 has a diesel-powered MTU MB 873 engine, which is much easier to maintain and more widely used across Europe, while the Abrams uses a more powerful and more complex turbine engine.According to Freedberg, because the Abram tanks are used significantly less across Europe, Ukraine may struggle to cope with logistic infrastructure such as obtaining spare parts, warehousing and general maintenance. The four-person tank will also require additional training on the complex machinery.(Al Jazeera)Russia’s ambassador to the US said the possible delivery of Abrams tanks to Kyiv by Washington would be “another blatant provocation” against Moscow and that the West would regret its “delusion” that Ukraine can win on the battlefield.Why are the tanks important to Ukraine?According to Alex Gatopoulos, Al Jazeera’s defence analyst, the latest-generation main battle tanks are vital for Ukraine if it wants to punch holes in Russian defensive lines and retake territory that Russian forces seized in the opening weeks of the invasion.Southern Ukraine is flat and ideal tank territory. Russia has been building rows of trenches and fortified bunkers to stop a Ukrainian advance in the area.In a Ukrainian offensive, tanks along with troops protected by infantry fighting vehicles like the American Bradley, German Mardar and even the Russian-made BMP-2 would advance.",0.13194,0.36774,2756,7,2,7,0,0
172,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/germany-to-send-leopard-2-tanks-to-ukraine,"Germany has confirmed that it will send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and approve their re-export from other countries, in a move that was hailed by Kyiv’s Western allies and decried by Russia as a dangerous escalation.Fourteen of the German-made tanks will be sent initially as part of Berlin’s historic move, which was announced on Wednesday.“This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability. We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement.The government said its goal was for Germany and its allies to provide Ukraine with a total of two battalions, or 88 tanks overall.Ukrainian troops will soon train in Germany, and Berlin will also provide logistics and ammunition, its statement added.The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, welcomed the news on social media, saying: “The first step on tanks has been taken … We need a lot of Leopards.”But the Russian embassy in Germany said Berlin’s decision meant it was abandoning its “historical responsibility to Russia” arising from Nazi crimes in World War II.The embassy said in a statement the decision would escalate the conflict to a new level.“This extremely dangerous decision takes the conflict to a new level of confrontation and contradicts the statements of German politicians about the unwillingness of the Federal Republic of Germany to be drawn into it,” Ambassador Sergei Nechayev said.For weeks, pressure had piled on Scholz to supply Kyiv with the tanks and allow other NATO allies to do the same in advance of expected spring offensives by both sides that could help turn the tide of the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed for 300 tanks from Western allies to unleash a “real punching fist of democracy” to force Russian troops out of his country.The United Kingdom has already pledged to deliver 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv, while the United States is reportedly poised to reverse its previous position and send dozens of its M1 Abrams to Ukraine.Moscow earlier said Western-supplied tanks will “burn” and dismissed suggestions they will affect the outcome of the nearly yearlong conflict.‘A big step towards stopping Russia’Significantly, Germany’s decision paves the way for other countries such as Poland and Finland to use their own reserves of Leopard tanks to support Ukraine.Several European nations have indicated their willingness to part with their units as part of a larger coalition.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak praised Scholz’s move as “the right decision”.“Together, we are accelerating our efforts to ensure Ukraine wins this war and secures a lasting peace,” he said.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who was the most vocal leader calling on Germany to greenlight the deliveries, said the decision marked “a big step towards stopping Russia”.But Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane, reporting from Berlin, said Germany may now face questions over why it took “so long” to reach a decision on supplying the tanks.“… many Leopard 2 tanks were sold by Germany to other European Union and NATO countries, and those are the countries that were beseeching Olaf Scholz to do what he has done now,” Kane said.“It looks as if in the course of the next few weeks and months these deliveries will take place.“But the people who will be using the tanks in Ukraine will need to be trained on how to use them.”",0.06277,0.31301,3440,8,5,6,0,1
173,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/25/russian-saboteurs-seek-to-hamper-putins-war-machine,"On the night of January 4, a section of tracks along the Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia’s Krasnoyarsk region was blown up. The rail line was used by the Russian army to transport supplies to Ukraine.A photo and video clip of an explosion ripping through a railway bridge were posted on Telegram by an organisation calling itself BOAK, the Combat Organisation of Anarcho-Communists.According to Ukrainian intelligence, this was the sixth such incident this year after 40 during all of 2022, suggesting that anti-war resistance in Russia is growing bolder.Since the invasion of Ukraine in February, Russian-occupied territories there have experienced regular sabotage from the Ukrainian resistance. But in Russia and Belarus, a secret network of activists is also doing its best to slow down the Russian war machine.“We are not only against Putin and the war but also against Russian imperialism and against the existing capitalist system of oppression in general,” a BOAK representative told Al Jazeera by email.BOAK describes itself as anarcho-communist, meaning it seeks a decentralised society in harmony with nature with a focus shifted away from profit and onto the needs of the people. It rejects all forms of inequality and oppression.This puts it at odds with Russia’s Communist Party, which embraces Stalinism and enthusiastically rallies behind President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.“We are disgusted by this fratricidal bloodbath, and we believe only by halting Putin’s aggression we can hope for this to stop and to never happen again,” the BOAK representative continued.“The government’s defeat in this imperialist war opens up opportunities for the revolutionary movement, giving people the chance to realise how oppressed they were, and what needs to change. We understand that these goals can only be achieved through revolutionary change, and in order to be implemented effectively, it is necessary to have an underground organisation operating using partisan and guerrilla methods.”PartisansBOAK and other Russian anti-war groups such as Stop the Trains call themselves partisans after the resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II when fighters hid in the forests of Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia and launched attacks on German forces.BOAK claims to have been in existence for 10 years, but it said that before the war in Ukraine, it largely spent its time building its network and gathering resources. In 2019, BOAK claimed responsibility for burning down a cellphone tower owned by a Turkish company in Kyiv over Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria.BOAK says it consists of several dozen cells of various sizes that operate independently, but the central network may help coordinate or publicise their actions. The central organisation follows a horizontal command structure, meaning that decisions that affect everyone in the organisation are made by consensus.The group locates their targets through open-source websites such as Wikimapia, and posts the results of its work on Telegram along with detailed instructions for other would-be saboteurs. In August, Telegram was fined by Russian authorities for refusing to take down the anarchists’ material.A favourite target of BOAK is railroads, which the army uses to move supplies to the front line.“They are the blood vessels that feed Russian aggression,” the representative explained. “It is along them that soldiers, equipment and ammunition are delivered. Stop them, and the Russian army will choke without resources.”At first, Russian authorities tried to play down the partisans’ activities, blaming derailments on faulty train lines, until Russian citizens started being arrested for committing acts of sabotage.Other targets have included army recruitment centres, police stations, national guard buildings and the ruling United Russia party’s offices. Since the start of the war, scores of draft offices and government buildings have been set alight, usually with Molotov cocktails, according to the independent Russian media outlet MediaZona.It’s not clear how many of these fires were directly orchestrated or inspired by BOAK. Some were caused by arsonists of various political persuasions and unaffiliated individuals on their own initiative.“While we can always be sceptical of claims, what we do know is claims of attacks and proof of those attacks, including photos and videos, are frequent enough that certainly attacks are occurring quite frequently, perhaps several per week,” Jeff Hawn, a non-resident fellow at the New Lines Institute think tank, told Al Jazeera.“Most, however, have very minimal impact: delaying but not stopping mobilisation of reservists from certain regions and hampering the movement of supplies to the front,” Hawn said “However, from a moral perspective, the impact is much larger. The regime knows the war is making people more willing to fight them directly, and Russian soldiers at the front know people behind the lines are against them.”Lethal forceAlthough the group has not yet carried out any assassinations, it is not against the use of lethal force and said it would only target state security officials. It said it takes care to minimise the risk to passers-by by targeting railways near military targets where civilian trains are unlikely to travel.“We consider the destruction of the oppressors of the people quite acceptable,” the spokesperson said.Serious doubt has been cast on reports of assassination plots by other groups.In August, Darya Dugina, a journalist and daughter of ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, died in a Moscow car bombing likely meant for her father. The Kremlin accused Kyiv of being behind her death, but Ilya Ponomarev, an exiled former member of Russia’s parliament now based in Kyiv, claimed it was the work of the National Republican Army (NRA), a secret organisation dedicated to the overthrow of Putin.However, historian Sergey Radchenko told Al Jazeera that the NRA does not exist.“Persistent rumours to this effect, when they are not part of some psyop operation, merely point to people’s frustration with the seeming political stability of Putin’s regime and suggest wishful thinking, which unfortunately is not rooted in any evidence,” Radchenko said.In April, six members of the outlawed National Socialism/White Power group were arrested by security services after allegedly plotting to assassinate TV pundit Vladimir Solovyov, a vocal cheerleader of Putin and the war.While the neo-Nazis group has thrown Molotov cocktails at draft offices, there are doubts over the official version of events in the supposed Solovyov plot with media reports suggesting the alleged crime scene was clumsily staged.Hawn said the groups engaged in anti-war activities have a wide range of ideologies and do not have a united vision for a post-Putin Russia, even as they unite against the president.“It’s hard to see these actions [real or otherwise] being the beginning of something bigger,” Hawn said. “However there is room for escalation.”“[It] is likely as time goes on, we will see tradecraft improving and a growing effectiveness in attacks,” he said.Railroad saboteurs have also been active in Belarus. Although it is not formally taking part in the war, the country is being used by Russian forces as a logistics hub.In Belarus, a number of railway saboteurs have been convicted of “terrorism”, which since May carries the death penalty.In the last days of December, Putin signed legislation into law that punishes the crime of sabotage with up to a life term in prison; up to 20 years for aiding, training or organising saboteurs; and up to 10 years for being part of a sabotage group.But BOAK said it is determined to continue its struggle for the overthrow of Putin.“We understand that such transformations do not happen overnight,” its spokesperson wrote.",-0.0066,0.39899,7859,5,12,21,9,0

A source familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency that the US commitment could total about 30 Abrams to be delivered over the coming months.(Al Jazeera)Berlin has also granted other countries, such as Poland and Finland, the licence to re-export their stocks of German-made tanks to Ukraine, German media reported on Tuesday citing unnamed government sources. Countries that buy military weapons from Germany are generally required to obtain permission from Berlin before re-exporting those weapons to another country.The Spiegel media outlet, which first reported the news of Scholz agreeing to provide tanks to Ukraine, said Germany would provide at least one company of Leopard 2A6 tanks out of the German army’s — the Bundeswehr’s — stocks. Generally, equipping a company means handing over more than 14 tanks.There was no official comment from the German government.The Kremlin has said supplying tanks to Ukraine would not change matters and that the West would regret its “delusion” that Kyiv could win on the battlefield against Russia.Russia’s ambassador to the US said the possible delivery of Abrams tanks to Kyiv by Washington would be “another blatant provocation” against Moscow.“It is obvious that Washington is purposefully trying to inflict a strategic defeat on us,” ambassador Anatoly Antonov said in remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram messaging app on Wednesday.“If the United States decides to supply tanks, then justifying such a step with arguments about ‘defensive weapons’ will definitely not work. This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation,” he said.(Al Jazeera)Until now, the US has resisted providing the M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, citing extensive and complex maintenance and logistical challenges with the high-tech weapons. Washington believed it would be more productive to send German Leopards since many allies have them and Ukrainian troops would need less training than on the more complex Abrams.By agreeing to send Abrams tanks, the US administration appears to be meeting the German Chancellor’s demand that Germany needed to be in lockstep with Washington.Scholz had held out for months against the growing chorus of people urging him to send Kyiv the tanks — not just Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but also NATO allies and members of Scholz’s coalition government.Zelenskyy took an especially tough line, saying Berlin’s foot-dragging was costing Ukrainian lives.Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane, reporting from Berlin, said the Leopard tanks could provide the Ukrainian army with advantages over Russian forces.“The thing to remember here is the real value that the main battle tank Leopard 2 possesses is that it is a heavier and faster tank than many of the tanks the Russian army has in Ukraine,” he said.“It’s also the case that very many different European Union countries have certain forms of the Leopard 2 tanks. The principle here is clear: There are many of them in the EU but also in NATO European countries,” he said. Germany is one of Ukraine’s biggest military donors. But there is scepticism about the value of sending tanks among a broad area of the German public who worry it could draw Germany more deeply into an escalating war in Eastern Europe.Kane said that while the German government has been prepared to provide Ukraine with armoured personnel carriers and its own form of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence systems, there was reluctance to send the Leopard 2 battle tank, an offensive weapon.“Germany has the historical legacy since World War II that weighs on all of the shoulders of German chancellors, in that they don’t want to be seen in direct confrontation with the Russians,” he said.Potential game-changerUkraine has been calling for Western-designed battle tanks for months to fight the invading Russian forces. The front line in eastern Ukraine has barely moved for weeks. With the tanks, Ukraine hopes to claw back more terrain seized by Russia.Analysts also say that Russia is preparing for a significant offensive in the spring, which in Ukraine begins in March.After media reports emerged on Tuesday of Germany’s decision, officials in Kyiv swiftly hailed what they said was a potential game-changer on the battlefield in a war that is 11 months old.“A few hundred tanks for our tank crews — the best tank crews in the world. This is what is going to become a real punching fist of democracy against the autocracy from the bog,” Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, wrote on Telegram. Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), welcomed the centre-left government’s move.“The decision is right,” the CDU chairman told the DPA news agency.Green Party legislators in the Bundestag, Germany’s federal parliament, also welcomed the decision.“The Leopard’s freed!” Bundestag Vice President Katrin Goring-Eckardt wrote on Twitter.“Now hopefully it can quickly help Ukraine in its fight against the Russian attack and for the freedom of Ukraine and Europe.”No Western-designed heavy tanks have yet been delivered to Ukraine for combat against Russian forces. So far, Ukraine has received only Soviet-made tanks that were in the inventory of Eastern European NATO countries.Of the 14 European states that have Leopard tanks, only Finland and Poland had so far publicly signalled their willingness to deliver them to Ukraine.

About 11 billion cubic metres of gas are stored in gas storages and nearly 1.2 million tonnes of coal are in storages.”Rescue workers clear the rubble from an apartment building that was destroyed in a Russian rocket attack at a residential neighbourhood in the southeastern city of Dnipro [Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Photo]Shmyhal added that the government had approved a decision to allow the state oil and gas company, Naftogaz, to receive a 189 million euro ($205m) grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and development.Despite a warmer-than-usual December and January, Ukraine’s regions are experiencing power blackouts due to an energy deficit.But Shmyhal said the country has continued to work with partners to speed up repair works, recover distribution facilities, and implement new energy efficiency programmes.Russia launched an aerial campaign of missile and drone attacks targeting Ukraine’s power infrastructure to increase the pressure on Kyiv over the winter after Ukrainian forces made a series of battlefield gains.Ukraine has condemned the aerial attacks as “war cimes”. Russia has consistently denied attacking civilian targets.At a meeting of Ukraine’s allies last week, pledges were made to send air defence systems and other weapons to bolster Kyiv’s capabilities to repel the Russian attacks.But Ukraine continues to ask Western countries to ramp up weapons deliveries, including battle tanks that it seeks for a potential new offensive against Russian forces in the coming months.Kyiv has pleaded for months for Western tanks, which it says it needs to give its forces the firepower and mobility to break through Russian defensive lines and recapture occupied territory.As Russia’s monthslong aerial campaign has continued, Ukrainian and Western military officials have said Moscow faces a shortage of arms after firing thousands of artillery shells and missiles at Ukraine since it invaded 11 months ago.Speaking on Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Russian weapons stocks were enough to continue fighting in Ukraine.Deputy head of Russia’s Security Council and chairman of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev visits the Kalashnikov Group plant in Izhevsk, Russia [Ekaterina Shtukina/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]“Our opponents are watching, they periodically make statements that we don’t have this or that … I want to disappoint them. We have enough of everything,” Medvedev said during a visit to a Kalashnikov factory in Izhevsk, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) east of Moscow.In a video posted on his Telegram channel, Medvedev was seen inspecting assault rifles, artillery shells, missiles and drones.Medvedev told officials during the visit that drones were in exceptionally high demand for its “special military operation”.Drones, used by the warring countries, have been seen as precise, cheap and safer to operate than manned aircraft.Medvedev, now deputy chairman of the Security Council, became head of a new military-industrial commission last December to oversee weapons production to support the war.He is one of Russia’s most hawkish pro-war voices.Last week, he said that a defeat in Ukraine could trigger a nuclear war.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.02324,0.3121,4514,10,6,16,0,0
178,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/24/as-pressure-mounts-germans-remain-conflicted-over-leopard-tanks,"Berlin, Germany – Ukrainian soldiers in the field now use German Gepard anti-aircraft guns to defend their skies, German anti-tank weapons to pierce Russian armour, and German howitzers to shell enemy troops.But the prize that Ukraine urgently seeks to regain territory before an expected Russian offensive this spring, the German-manufactured Leopard 2 battle tank, remains frustratingly out of reach.Germany is one of the largest donors of military hardware to Ukraine, but over 11 months of war, Berlin has only stepped up deliveries under pressure and only after other allies made the first move.If it were to provide the battle tanks, or even licence the re-export of Leopards from other countries’ arsenals, it would mark the first time that Berlin has led on weapons exports since the war began.That step has so far proven too much for Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his allies in the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who insist on a careful course, which they say is in step with Germany’s NATO allies, and guided by a sceptical German public and a fear of escalating the war in Ukraine.This hesitance has divided the SPD from its coalition partners and led to some international allies, especially in Eastern Europe, accusing Germany of shirking its responsibilities as a major European power.“Modern, Western-built tanks have become a kind of a symbol for your readiness to support Ukraine, a symbol of your willingness to take risks, a symbol for your willingness to stand up against Russian aggression,” said Matthias Dembinski, a senior researcher at the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt.“If Germany continues to refuse to deliver tanks, the reputational damage will be significant. And if [it does], this might indeed be a symbolic break with the historical traditions of Germany, and especially the Social Democratic foreign security policy.”Confusion simmers in EuropeBoth of the SPD’s coalition partners, the Green Party and Free Democrats, support sending Leopards to Ukraine.The final decision has to be approved by Scholz, who has built a reputation as a risk-averse and stubborn leader, and whose own party is less hawkish on Russia and more adverse to Germany flexing its military power.Scholz defended Germany’s support for Ukraine during a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Sunday, and stressed the importance of working alongside the United States.“As we’ve done in the past, always closely coordinating with all our friends and allies to discuss the particular situation, we will also proceed to do in the future,” he told reporters.After days of confusion about whether a formal request for re-export had been submitted by any of the 14 countries that stock the Leopard 2, Germany confirmed on Tuesday that Poland had officially asked for the green light.Earlier, Warsaw said that regardless of Berlin’s position, it would make its own decisions.And German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has said that she would “not stand in the way” of any country that wished to send the tanks.Meanwhile, speculation about Scholz is growing – from critics internationally, domestically, and even within his own coalition government.“Does anyone understand him?” asked an editorial in the liberal newspaper Die Zeit, which compared the chancellery’s transparency, or lack thereof, to the Kremlin’s.“He’s not coordinating the communication, and this creates this kind of cacophony in the end,” said Stefan Meister of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “And he, who is the key decision maker on any weapons supply? He’s not saying anything.”SPD politics and the public moodThe SPD has long favoured practical relations with Russia and remains proud of its legacy of Ostpolitik, under which Chancellor Willy Brandt sought more open relations with East Germany and the Soviet Union.“It was kind of a dogma of these Social Democrats for decades that peace in Europe can only be achieved with Russia, and so they invested a lot of political capital in this kind of détente policy,” Dembinski told Al Jazeera.But the Ukraine war has forced a U-turn.Last year Scholz pledged 100 billion euros ($109bn) to modernise Germany’s armed forces and vowed to take a more active role in shaping international security policy.Progress has been slow, and an influential left-wing bloc has been less enthused about the project, despite party leadership promises that the goals will be met.A general view of a mobile defence surface-to-air missile system, Patriot, before it is transported to Poland from Gnoien, Germany [Annegret Hilse/Reuters]“It’s important to guarantee and organise Europe’s security against Russia,” SPD Co-Chair Lars Klingbeil said on Monday at the launch of a new strategy paper, which argued for the party to deliver on Scholz’s so-called “Zeitenwende”, or epochal change.Yet the fear of Russia following through with its nuclear threats if Western states increase their military involvement is taken seriously by many in the SPD, including Scholz, who has raised the issue several times in recent months.His spokesperson has said the chancellor has received letters and emails from the public, praising his approach of attempting to avoid a major escalation of the war.Although Germany is one of the world’s largest arms exporters, the country has a conflicted view of itself as a military power. Pacifism is common, and many believe Germany should play a mediating, diplomatic role in international affairs.There is also particular discomfort in sending weapons to regions of Eastern Europe that were invaded by Germany during World War II.A DeutschlandTrend poll last week found that 46 percent of Germans support sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, 43 percent were opposed, and 11 percent were undecided.Support was lowest among young people and those living in states that were formerly part of East Germany.Another poll by Forsa found 54 percent supported allowing the re-export of Leopards from other countries to Ukraine, but 58 percent were against those tanks being used to recapture Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014.”’More weapons will not bring peace’ is a formula that many in society would sign,” said Meister.Ukrainian hopesDespite the current impasse, the Ukrainian government has appeared confident that a breakthrough will be made, and that its troops will soon begin training to take German tanks into battle.“I have no doubt that we will receive Leopards,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Monday evening.“The only question is when, and now we are focused on making it happen, sooner rather than later.”Kuleba requested that all countries with Leopards who were willing to donate them submit a formal request to Germany as soon as possible.“This is the move that will make the whole situation crystal clear and we will see where it takes Germany,” he added.To the many Ukrainians in Germany, which hosts more than one million refugees who have fled the war, the wait for what appears to be the inevitable is nerve-wracking.During the discussions at Ramstein Air Base on Friday, Vitsche, a Ukrainian activist group, staged a protest outside the chancellery in Berlin, calling for Scholz to immediately approve heavy tank deliveries.“I’m very sure it’s going to come,” spokesperson Krista-Marija Läbe told Al Jazeera.“In the meantime, more people will die, especially on the Ukrainian side. So I would like that the German government starts to act faster, starts to act with more assertiveness.”",0.0945,0.41796,7530,9,9,9,0,0
179,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/24/why-is-south-africa-neutral-in-ukraine-russia-war,"The United States has criticised South Africa’s decision to hold military exercises next month with Russia and China as the war in Ukraine rages on.The exercises – called Mosi, which means “Smoke” in Tswana, one of South Africa’s 11 official languages – will see 350 of South Africa’s soldiers train alongside their Russian and Chinese counterparts.The drills will happen off South Africa’s coast from February 17 to 27 and will take place during the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.“The United States has concerns about any country … exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said on Monday.The comments from Washington came hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with his South African counterpart, Naledi Pandor, in Pretoria.South Africa defended its decision to hold the drills.“All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,” Pandor told reporters. “There should be no compulsion on any country that it should conduct them with any other partners.”She said the exercises were “part of a natural course of relations between countries”, adding that Pretoria should not be denied “the right to participate” in the drills.Lavrov said there was no need for any country to be concerned about them.“Our exercises are transparent,” he told reporters. “We, together with our South African and Chinese partners, have provided all the relevant information. We don’t want to provoke any scandals or confrontation. We just want every country to be able to have their own rights in the international systems as provided by the UN Charter.”South African government officials described Lavrov’s visit, which came a day before US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was due to arrive in South Africa, as an ordinary visit.Lavrov’s trip has nevertheless been described as insensitive by some opposition parties and the small Ukrainian community in South Africa.To understand why the trip is getting so much attention within and outside the country, it is important to examine Pretoria’s stance in the war and its relationship with Moscow.What is South Africa’s position on the conflict?South Africa says it is impartial in the conflict, which started after Russia sent its troops into Ukraine 11 months ago.In March, Pretoria abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and calling for Moscow to withdraw its forces immediately.South Africa, along with 34 other countries, also abstained from a vote at the UN condemning Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories in October.“South Africa believes that the only path to peace is through diplomacy, dialogue and a commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter, including the principles that all member states shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means,” Pandor said in her remarks after the meeting Lavrov.“It is important, therefore, to mention our sincere wish that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will be brought to a peaceful end through diplomacy and negotiations as speedily as possible,” she said.But South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has offered to mediate in the conflict, has blamed NATO for the war. The alliance ought to have “heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region”, he said in March.Why is South Africa neutral?Pretoria and Moscow have long historical ties dating back to the times of white minority rule in South Africa.South Africa’s ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC) has longstanding relations with Moscow forged during the liberation struggle against apartheid. Many of the ANC leaders were educated or received military training in the Soviet Union. Some, like the late Eric “Stalin” Mtshali, have Russian nicknames thanks to their connections to Moscow.The Soviet Union backed the liberation movement with arms and money. This was in stark contrast to the West, where the United States labelled the ANC a “terrorist organisation”. Washington considered the liberation hero Nelson Mandela a “terrorist” until 2008.South Africa is also a member of the Non-Alligned Movement. The 120-country movement, formed during the Cold War, is not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc or superpower.Since gaining independence in 1994, a core pillar of South Africa’s foreign policy when it comes to conflict resolution has been to call for dialogue. Pretoria has backed peace talks in several conflicts in Africa and most recently hosted peace talks between Ethiopia’s government and rebels from its Tigray region.Pandor has repeatedly insisted that South Africa will not be dragged into taking sides and has criticised the West for selective condemnation of Russia while ignoring other acts of aggression like the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.Are there other ties between Moscow and Pretoria?Both South Africa and Russia are members of BRICS, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The bloc aims to promote trade and security ties between member countries.South Africa, the most industrialised country in Africa, has been a trade partner with Russia for years. South African exports to Russia were valued at $587m in 2020 while Russian exports to South Africa totalled $506m.(Al Jazeera) How is the government’s stance viewed in South Africa?Last week, the foundation of the late South African Archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu criticised the naval exercises, calling the drills “disgraceful” and “tantamount to a declaration that South Africa is joining the war against Ukraine”.The Democratic Alliance, the country’s main opposition party, has also been vocal in its opposition to the government’s neutral stance, calling on South Africa to side with Kyiv.“We are already involved in this war,” John Steenhuisen, the party’s leader, told parliament in March. “Our government can’t be seen to be supporting Russia’s aggression.”“Let’s put the country before party politics and think what this war will mean to us and what will be its impact on our economy,” he said.Steenhuisen also visited Ukraine in May for a fact-finding mission.",0.04827,0.33874,6322,8,10,17,0,0

He said that Poland is building a coalition of nations ready to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.“Even if we didn’t get such an approval in the end, we will give our tanks to Ukraine anyway – within a small coalition of countries, even if Germany isn’t in that coalition,” Morawiecki said.‘Killing more of our people’Ukraine, which is still using Soviet-era tanks, has said the world’s indecision is only “killing more of our people”.Poland announced earlier this month that it was ready to deliver 14 Leopard tanks to Kyiv but was waiting for a clear statement from Berlin authorising the transfer.Berlin has insisted on the need for all allies to work together.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s spokesman reiterated that stance Monday, saying the government “does not rule out” the tanks’ transfer but adding: “It has not yet decided.”Although Berlin has provided substantial aid, it has been repeatedly criticised for dragging its feet on providing military hardware.German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said it was important for Germany not to take a “reckless” step it might regret, adding that a decision will not be rushed.“These are hard questions of life and death,” he added. “We have to ask what this means for the defence of our own country.”Pressed on how long a decision on sending tanks might take, Hebestreit said: “I assume that it’s not a question of months now.”Julian Pawlak, a research associate at the University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, said that although many countries including the United Kingdom and United States have sent various weapons to Ukraine, it is still a “long way before really sending those numbers of 300 tanks or 600 infantry fighting vehicles”.While Ukraine continues to use Soviet-era tanks, at some point in the future “numbers will go down and Ukraine will depend more and more on western ammunition and consequently, also more on western assets,” Pawlak told Al Jazeera.Haunted by its post-World War II guilt, Germany has always acted carefully when it comes to conflicts.Under Germany’s War Weapons Control Act, Poland and other purchasing countries require Berlin’s approval to hand over the Leopard tanks to Ukraine.The act aims to prevent German-made armaments from being used in conflict zones against Germany’s interests.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the latest developments on Western Europe sending tanks to Ukraine “signalled increasing nervousness among members of the alliance”.On Friday, some 50 nations agreed to provide Kyiv with billions of dollars’ worth of military hardware, including armoured vehicles and munitions needed to push back Russian forces.European foreign ministers on Monday agreed to spend an extra 500 million euros ($543m) to arm Ukraine, diplomats said. This takes the total common European Union spending to 3.6 billion euros ($3.9bn).Ukraine has called the tanks key to its effort in the war, which has seen heavy fighting in the nation’s east.Neither side shows signs of backing down as the war heads for a second year.",0.10127,0.42432,4095,13,8,2,0,0
184,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/23/ex-fbi-agent-violated-sanctions-by-aiding-russian-oligarch-doj,"A former top Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official has been charged with violating US sanctions by aiding a sanctioned Russian billionaire, according to the US Department of Justice (DOJ).In an indictment unsealed on Monday, prosecutors alleged former FBI agent Charles McGonigal worked on behalf of Russian energy magnate Oleg Deripaska, providing services that included seeking to have United States sanctions against Deripaska lifted and investigating a rival oligarch.He was also accused of hiding payments from Deripaska.McGonigal had been the special agent in charge of the FBI counterintelligence division in New York before his retirement in 2018. He had supervised investigations of Russian oligarchs during his tenure, according to DOJ officials.In a statement released on Monday, FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael Driscoll said: “Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska perform global malign influence on behalf of the Kremlin and are associated with acts of bribery, extortion, and violence”.“Supporting a designated threat to the United States and our allies is a crime the FBI will continue to pursue aggressively.”Deripaska was sanctioned in 2018, per an order issued by former President Barack Obama in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea.The order blocked the property of all individuals determined “to be responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threatened the security, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine, or who materially assist, sponsor, or provide support to individuals or entities engaging in such activities”.The order further prohibited individuals from “making or receiving any funds, goods, or services by, to, from, or for the benefit of any person designated by the US Treasury”, according to the DOJ.Among the allegations, prosecutors said McGonigal worked with Russian-diplomat-turned-interpreter Sergey Shestakov in 2021 to investigate a “rival Russian oligarch” in return for secret payments.The duo allegedly sought to conceal Deripaska’s identity through shell companies and forged signatures.Prosecutors also said that McGonigal and Shestakov had in 2019 worked on behalf of Deripaska “in an unsuccessful effort to have the sanctions against Deripaska lifted”.The pair were charged with violating and conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, conspiring to commit money laundering and money laundering. The charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.Shestakov is also charged with making false statements to the FBI.McGonigal and Shestakov were arrested on Saturday — McGonigal after landing at John F Kennedy International Airport and Shestakov at his home in Morris, Connecticut — and held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York.McGonigal pleaded not guilty on Monday and was released on $500,000 bail. Shestakov also pleaded not guilty and was released on $200,000 bail.“This is obviously a distressing day for Mr McGonigal and his family,” McGonigal’s lawyer, Seth DuCharme, told reporters after the Manhattan hearing. “We’ll review the evidence, we’ll closely scrutinise it, and we have a lot of confidence in Mr McGonigal.”The US has stepped up its enforcement of sanctions violations by prominent Russian figures in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which will enter its 12th month on Tuesday.",0.06303,0.29335,3349,2,0,9,0,0

He has done many bad things in his life,” the rights group said.“But he has seen the light, he has realised this, he is ready and willing to cooperate with the world, with the international investigation and with the authorities of Norway, he wants to live and testify” against Wagner and its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, it added.Medvedev is an orphan who joined the Russian army and served time in prison before joining the Wagner Group last July on a four-month contract.He claims Wagner repeatedly extended his contract without his consent.He has reportedly told Gulagu.net that he is ready to expose everything he knows about the force of mercenary fighters, which Washington has said will be considered a criminal entity.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00464,0.35417,3006,1,0,7,0,0

(Al Jazeera)Pandor has repeatedly insisted that South Africa will not be dragged into taking sides, and has criticised the West for selective condemnation of Russia while ignoring other acts of aggression like the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.Even as South Africa has proclaimed impartiality on the conflict and abstained from voting on United Nations resolutions, it has retained close relations with Russia, historically a friend of the governing African National Congress when it was a liberation movement against white minority rule.Both countries have also been trade partners for years, with South African exports to Russia reaching $587m in 2020, while Russian exports to South Africa totalled $506m.The South African military is set to host a joint military exercise with Russia and China on its east coast on February 17 to 27, a move likely to further strain ties with Washington and European countries. It coincides with the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year.But John Steenhuisen, leader of South Africa’s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), who went on a fact-finding mission to Ukraine in May 2022, has often disagreed with his government’s position.“Russia’s expansion into Africa has been through ‘elite capture’, where pliable leaders are ensnared in long-term patronage schemes,” Steenhuisen claimed.​​​​​ “Fifteen African nations are currently involved in Russian-financed nuclear power deals, and many more are locked into Russian security contracts.”Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.00729,0.24,3525,5,2,15,0,0

We need to make sure people’s lives are saved and Ukraine’s territory liberated.”The comments appeared to signal that Berlin was ready to authorise European countries to deliver German-made tanks to Ukraine amid growing pressure from Kyiv and other allies for such a move. Under the license agreement, countries cannot send German tanks without Berlin’s approval.So far, no Western-designed main battle tanks have been delivered to Ukraine for defensive combat against invading Russian forces.Ukraine has repeatedly urged its Western allies to deliver more, and faster, military aid to the war-torn country. “Every day of delay is the death of Ukrainians. Think faster,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Saturday.The criticism came after 50 countries met at the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and agreed to supply Kyiv with billions of dollars of military hardware, including armoured vehicles and munitions.But a decision by Germany over the delivery of the much-requested Leopard 2 combat tanks – considered one of the best-performing models worldwide – failed to materialise.Despite intense pressure and criticism, Germany said it had not decided yet on whether to give permission to other European countries to transfer the German-made tanks to Ukraine.Poland has announced it is ready to deliver 14 Leopard tanks to Kyiv but Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Sunday he was waiting for “a clear statement” from Berlin whether countries that have the Leopards can transfer them to Ukraine.He also described Germany’s refusal to send its own tanks to Ukraine as “unacceptable”.“Innocent people are dying every day,” he told the PAP news agency.In a joint statement on Saturday, the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states – Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – urged Germany “to provide Leopard tanks to Ukraine now”.Earlier on Sunday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said all decisions on weapons deliveries would be made in coordination with allies, including the United States.Speaking on a visit to Paris to celebrate 60 years since the signing of a landmark treaty between France and Germany, Scholz said Berlin had always in the past acted “in close coordination with our friends and allies”.French President Emmanuel Macron said he did not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks – France’s main battle tanks – to Ukraine.“As for the Leclerc, I asked the ministry to work on it. Nothing is ruled out,” Macron said but stressed that any effort to dispatch the hardware should be decided and coordinated “collectively” with allies, including Germany.(Al Jazeera)",0.05108,0.39964,3053,10,4,2,0,0

In a joint declaration, the countries said they would “stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”.They also pledged to “work together for a European Union that is more resilient, more sustainable and more capable to act independently”.

Both leaders will oversee two rounds of talks at the Elysee Palace, focusing on energy and economic policy as well as defence.“Let us use our inseparable friendship … to shape the present and future of our continent, together with our European partners,” Scholz said at the ceremony at the Sorbonne.After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, the European peace project is at a “turning point”, he said.“Putin’s imperialism will not win … We will not allow Europe to revert to a time when violence replaced politics and our continent was torn apart by hatred and national rivalries.”Macron added: “Our unfailing support for the Ukrainian people will continue in every field.”Pierre Haski, a political analyst, said the meeting comes as an occasion to show how France and Germany still hold trust and confidence in each other.“This was a good occasion … a political expression, a joint commitment to supporting Ukraine and solving the problem between them in Europe,” Haski said.Paris and Berlin have adopted different approaches on several issues, from handling the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout to the energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of its neighbouring country has exposed differences in strategy between the two nations, notably in European talks about how to deal with the resulting energy crisis and punishing inflation, as well as over future military investment.Macron has called for “a new energy model” in the EU based on diversifying supplies and encouraging carbon-free energy production.“In times of crisis, every time there has been a crisis, France and Germany have difficulty in finding a common approach, but in the end they find it,” Haski said, pointing to the German and French initiative to establish European recovery funds in 2020 to support European countries worst hit by the pandemic.The meeting comes as leaders across Europe fear distortions in transatlantic trade from the United States Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which will pour billions of dollars into US-made, climate-friendly technologies.The legislation includes subsidies for US electric car makers and other businesses – a move considered unfair by France.Paris is pushing for the EU to relax rules on state subsidies in order to accelerate their allocation, simplify the bloc’s support for investments and create an EU sovereign fund to boost green industries.

Sweden’s ruling party followed shortly after.May 16, 2022President Erdogan confirmed Turkey’s opposition to NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, shooting down a proposal by the Nordic countries to send delegations to Ankara to address the matter.“We will not say ‘yes’ to those [countries] who apply sanctions to Turkey to join security organisation NATO,” Erdogan said at a news conference, referring to Sweden’s 2019 decision to suspend arms sales to Turkey over its military operation in neighbouring Syria.Turkey also accused the two nations of harbouring “terror” groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), blacklisted by Ankara, the European Union and the United States.Justice ministry sources told the state news agency Anadolu on Monday that Sweden and Finland had failed to respond positively to Turkey’s 33 extradition requests over the past five years.May 18, 2022Finland and Sweden officially applied to join the world’s biggest military alliance. The move requires the unanimous approval of the alliance’s 30 current members. The process was expected to take about two weeks.June 28, 2022Turkey lifted its veto over Finland and Sweden’s NATO bid after four hours of talks just before a NATO summit began in Madrid.Turkey’s justice minister announced that as part of the deal, his country will seek the extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish fighters and coup plot suspects from Sweden and Finland.December 19, 2022Sweden’s Supreme Court blocked the extradition of an exiled Turkish journalist, a key demand by Ankara.There were “several hindrances” to sending back former editor-in-chief of the Zaman daily, Bulent Kenes, whom Turkey accuses of being involved in a 2016 attempt to topple Erdogan, the court said.December 22, 2022Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden is not even halfway through fulfilling the commitments it made to secure Ankara’s support for its membership.He said a Swedish court’s decision not to extradite a man wanted by Turkey for alleged links to a failed 2016 coup had “poisoned” a positive atmosphere in negotiations.January 8, 2023Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden cannot fulfil Turkey’s demands, but he is confident Ankara will approve its bid to join NATO.January 12, 2023Turkey summons Sweden’s ambassador to answer for a video posted by the pro-Kurd Rojava Committee of Sweden that depicted an Erdogan effigy swinging by his legs from a rope.A tweet by the group on January 11 compared Erdogan to Italy’s Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was hung upside down after his execution in the closing days of World War II.January 21, 2023Turkish officials denounced the permission granted to Rasmus Paludan, a right-wing Swedish-Danish politician, to stage a protest in front of its embassy in the Swedish capital.After a diatribe of almost an hour in which he attacked Islam and immigration in Sweden, Paludan set fire to a copy of the Quran.Swedish police gave their authorisation for the demonstration after determining it fell under the country’s liberal freedom of speech laws. But Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said allowing the protest was “encouraging hate crimes and Islamophobia”.Subsequently, a group of protesters set fire to a Swedish flag at a rally outside its consulate in Istanbul and called on Turkey to cut diplomatic ties with Stockholm.A day after summoning the Swedish ambassador over Paludan’s latest demo, Ankara said it called off defence minister Pal Jonson’s visit scheduled for January 27, aimed at overcoming Turkey’s objections to Sweden’s NATO bid.January 29, 2023In a televised speech, Erdogan signaled that Turkey could accept Finland into NATO before taking any action on the membership of its Nordic neighbour Sweden.He repeated his demand for Sweden to hand over some 120 alleged suspects.“If you absolutely want to join NATO, you will return these terrorists to us,” Erdogan said.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",-0.02196,0.34279,5843,1,1,1,0,0

However, Washington has indicated that t did not believe providing its Abrams tanks would be helpful due to difficulties in training and maintenance.On Friday, around 50 US-led countries gathered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany for the Ukraine Contact group meeting. There were expectations before the meeting that Germany would at least agree to let other countries operating Leopards transfer them to Kyiv’s army.US Senator Lindsey Graham, on a visit to Kyiv, called on both countries to supply the machines.“To the Germans: Send tanks to Ukraine because they need them. It is in your own national interest that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin loses in Ukraine.”“To the [US President Joe] Biden Administration: Send American tanks so that others will follow our lead,” he said.The top US general underscored the substantial amount of equipment Ukraine was being pledged at Ramstein, including armoured vehicles, artillery and the large-scale training of its forces by allies.“I do think it’s very possible for the Ukrainians to run a significant tactical or even operational-level offensive operation to liberate as much Ukrainian territory as possible,” US Joint Chiefs chairman General Mark Milley said.But the Kremlin said on Friday that Western tanks would make little difference on the battlefield.“One should not exaggerate the importance of such supplies in terms of the ability to change something,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Russia’s offensive on ZaporizhiaThe criticism came as Russia said it has launched an offensive in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region after several months of an almost frozen front line.Moscow’s forces said they had carried out “offensive operations” in the region and claimed to have “taken more advantageous lines and positions”, according to the Russian defence ministry’s daily report.Russia said it had also held a training exercise on repelling air attacks in the Moscow region, using an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system.Ukraine’s defence ministry reported 26 air raids and 15 attacks from multiple-launch rocket systems Saturday.“The enemy does not abandon its aggressive plans, focusing its main efforts on attempts to fully occupy the Donetsk region,” on Ukraine’s border with Russia, it said.Source: News AgenciesAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network",0.05873,0.32794,5509,19,2,10,1,1

But Kyiv has pleaded for more advanced military equipment to get the upper hand in the fight against Russia.The United States and its allies failed to agree to supply the coveted German battle tanks to Ukraine at a meeting on Friday, as Russia continued to issue threats the conflict may escalate in Europe.Leopard 2 tanks are considered one of the best-performing models worldwide and are widely used across Europe.(Al Jazeera)Why are the Leopards so coveted?Leopard was first produced in the late 1970s to replace the American M48 Patton and soon became renowned for its firepower, mobility, and sturdy armour.Leopard 2 is “sort of like the [Volkswagen] Golf of the German tank industry: an all-rounder with world recognition”, according to the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.About 3,500 of the 60-tonne battle tanks, developed by German weapons manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), have been produced.The tanks are armed with a 120mm smoothbore cannon and can move at speeds of up to 70 kilometres (44 miles) per hour with a range of 500km (310 miles). They also provide “all-round protection” for troops from threats such as mines, anti-tank fire, and improvised explosive devices, according to the manufacturer.The last four models produced are still in use – from the 2A4 to the 2A7.What is stopping the supply?Germany has been reluctant to provide the tanks to Ukraine because of the anti-militarism position it adopted after World War II. However, pressure has been mounting on Germany and it has been put in a difficult position.Poland has expressed willingness to send 14 Leopard tanks to Ukraine as part of an international coalition. Finland said it is not opposed to shipments.But countries cannot send the tanks without Germany’s approval as they are supplied under a German licence.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has suggested Poland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without Germany’s blessing.It is not clear yet how quickly any tanks would arrive. German weapons manufacturer Rheinmetall, which produces the Leopard’s cannon and electronics and has dozens of older models, has said it would not be able to deliver any of the tanks until 2024 because of the need to refurbish and repair them.We, 🇱🇻 🇪🇪 🇱🇹 Foreign Ministers, call on Germany to provide Leopard tanks to Ukraine now. This is needed to stop Russian aggression, help Ukraine and restore peace in Europe quickly. Germany as the leading European power has special responsibility in this regard.— Edgars Rinkēvičs (@edgarsrinkevics) January 21, 2023What is Russia saying?Some analysts have said supplying the Leopards could further escalate the conflict with Russia, if it were construed as the direct involvement of NATO countries in the war.Russia has warned of an “extremely dangerous” escalation if NATO were to deploy high-tech weapons. The introduction of such weapons, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov would bring the war to “a whole new level, which, of course, will not bode well from the point of view of global and pan-European security.”Anatoly Antonov, Moscow’s ambassador to the US, said Russia would retaliate if Ukraine were to use Western-supplied weapons to target Russia or the Crimea Peninsula.Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior security official, warned the West’s continued support for Ukraine could lead to nuclear war.What impact could the Leopards have?Supplying Ukraine with about 100 tanks could make a “significant” difference in the war, according to the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.“An army can break through enemy lines and put an end to a long period of trench warfare,” Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger told Germany’s Bild newspaper. “With the Leopard soldiers can advance dozens of kilometres at a time.”But Ukrainian troops would need to be rapidly trained to use the equipment, whose operations are much more complicated than the Soviet-era tanks.The Ukrainian military would also be trying to get up to speed on other new hardware set to arrive in Ukraine, including recently pledged French AMX-10 RC light tanks, German Marder infantry vehicles, and Bradley fighting vehicles from the United States.",0.04553,0.33627,4479,12,10,10,0,0

He said Berlin was not alone among Ukraine’s allies in its concerns about the delivery.Addressing the meeting, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said partners needed “not to bargain about different numbers of tanks but to open that principal supply that will stop evil”.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said countries backing Ukraine need to focus not only on sending new weapons to Kyiv but also on providing ammunition for older systems.The Kremlin said Western countries supplying tanks to Ukraine would not change the course of the conflict but would add to the problems of the Ukrainian people.Diplomacy:The US has designated Russia’s Wagner Group as a “transnational criminal organisation”, raising pressure on the private Russian army fighting in Ukraine.The paramilitary group has denied it was recruiting Serbians, a day after activists filed criminal complaints against the organisation in Belgrade.The Kremlin said its relations with the US were at an all-time low halfway through President Joe Biden’s term and there was no hope of improvement.Humanitarian aid:For the first time since Russia’s war in Ukraine began, a United Nations humanitarian convoy arrived in the eastern region of Donetsk with aid for civilians.

198,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/21/us-deems-russias-wagner-mercenaries-a-criminal-organisation,"The United States has said it will designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group as a “transnational criminal organisation”, piling pressure on the private army that has recruited tens of thousands of Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday that Wagner, controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, had about 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, 80 percent of them drawn from Russia’s prison system.Wagner “is a criminal organisation that is committing widespread atrocities and human rights abuses”, Kirby said.“We will work relentlessly to identify, disrupt, expose and target those who are assisting Wagner,” he said.Kirby also showed US intelligence photographs of North Korea apparently supplying arms to Wagner for its Ukraine operations, and said the private mercenary force has become a rival to the formal Russian military.The photographs, from November 18-19, show Russian rail cars entering North Korea, picking up a load of infantry rockets and missiles, and returning to Russia, Kirby said. He said the US Treasury would formally designate Wagner as a transnational criminal organisation, putting it in league with the Italian mafia and Japanese and Russian organised crime.John Kirby presents satellite images showing Russian railcars travelling between Russia and North Korea, during a press briefing at the White House, Washington, DC, on January 20, 2023 [Leah Millis/Reuters]The designation will allow a wider application of sanctions against the group’s sprawling global network, which includes mercenary operations as well as businesses in Africa and elsewhere.Declaring Wagner a “Transnational Criminal Organization” under US executive order 13581 would freeze any US assets of Wagner and prohibits US nationals from providing funds, goods or services to the group.Kirby also said the US had presented its intelligence on Wagner’s North Korean arms purchases to the United Nations Security Council’s unit on North Korea sanctions. The arms transfers from North Korea are in direct violation of UN Security Council resolutions, he said.Wagner owner Prigozhin last month denied taking delivery of arms from North Korea and characterised the report as “gossip and speculation”.In a short letter to the White House published on Saturday, he asked what crime his company was accused of. “Dear Mr Kirby, Could you please clarify what crime was committed by PMC Wagner?”, the head of the private military contractor wrote in a letter posted on his Telegram channel.Prigozhin has described Wagner as a fully independent force with its own aircraft, tanks, rockets and artillery. He is wanted in the United States for interference in US elections, something that he said in November he had done and would continue to do.Kirby also said there is evidence that Prigozhin’s confidence in his fighters’ relative success in Ukraine has generated tensions within the Kremlin.“Wagner is becoming a rival power centre to the Russian military and other Russian ministries,” Kirby said.“Prigozhin is trying to advance his own interest in Ukraine and Wagner is making military decisions based largely on what they will generate for Prigozhin, in terms of positive publicity.”Prigozhin has claimed credit for Russian advances over several months towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, including the capture last week of the neighbouring town of Soledar.On Thursday, Prigozhin said in a press statement that Russia had “a lot to learn” from Ukraine’s army. But he insisted “the settlement of Artemovsk will be captured”, using the Russian name for Bakhmut.Prigozhin’s rivals in the KremlinThe Wagner mercenary force was founded in 2014 and has been involved in conflicts in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. But, Prigozhin’s infighting with officials in the Kremlin could be hurting him.According to the US’s Institute for the Study of War, Putin “is increasingly siding with” Prigozhin’s rivals in high-level power circles.Putin has also not directly credited Wagner with the Bakhmut area successes, the institute noted.“Putin is likely attempting to reduce Prigozhin’s prominence in favour of the re-emerging professional Russian military and Russian government officials,” the group said on Thursday.Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he had designated the Wagner Group as an “entity of particular concern” for its activities in the Central African Republic.Wagner has been under US sanctions since 2017. The Commerce Department last month unveiled new export restrictions targeting Wagner in a bid to further limit its access to technology and supplies.The European Union imposed sanctions on Wagner in 2021 and named individuals linked to the group for their involvement “in serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings”.Wagner had been involved “in destabilising activities in some of the countries they operate in, including Libya, Syria, Ukraine (Donbas) and the Central African Republic. The group is also spreading its malign influence elsewhere, notably in the Sahel region,” the EU said.",0.01371,0.23858,5204,7,2,17,4,0
199,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/20/no-leopard-tanks-for-ukraine-as-nato-allies-fail-to-agree,"The United States and its allies failed to agree on supplying coveted German battle tanks to Ukraine as Russia issued veiled threats the war could escalate in Europe.NATO and defence leaders from about 50 countries met at the American Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Friday, the latest in a series of arms-pledging conferences since Russia invaded Ukraine 11 months ago.European leaders at the meeting again pressed Germany to give the green light for the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine to drive back Moscow’s forces – although no decision was made.The failure to agree to provide the tanks may signal growing divisions within NATO over supplying such weapons.Germany’s defence minister Boris Pistorius denied Berlin was unilaterally blocking the delivery of the Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but said his government was ready to move quickly on the issue if there were consensus among allies.“There are good reasons for the deliveries and there are good reasons against, and in view of the entire situation of a war that has been ongoing for almost one year, all pros and cons must be weighed very carefully,” he said, without elaborating on the reasons.Pressure has been building on Berlin to provide tanks to Kyiv that Ukraine sees as key in the war against Russia.The impression “there is a united coalition and that Germany is standing in the way is wrong”, Pistorius said, adding “there are many allies who say we share the view that I have put forward here.”Pistorius said while there was no decision yet on whether to send the Leopard tanks, “We will make our decisions as soon as possible.”“I am very sure that there will be a decision in the short term but … I don’t know how the decision will look,” he said.Leopard tanks are seen as especially suitable as they are widely in use, meaning several countries could each chip in some of their tanks to support Ukraine.‘Cause for regret’Russia, meanwhile, said the West supplying battle tanks to Ukraine will not change the course of the war and Kyiv’s allies will regret their “delusions” that such a move will prove victorious on the battlefield.“We have repeatedly said that such supplies will not fundamentally change anything, but will add problems for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Asked whether the supply of increasingly advanced weapons to Ukraine meant the conflict was escalating, he added, “We see a growing indirect and sometimes direct involvement of NATO countries in this conflict.“We see a devotion to the dramatic delusion that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield. This is a dramatic delusion of the Western community that will more than once be cause for regret.”Peskov said the way to prevent escalation was to heed the strategic concerns that Russia expressed in late 2021, just before it invaded Ukraine.Before launching its February 24, 2022, invasion, Moscow blamed NATO for undermining the region’s security and sent a list of security demands to the United States.Russia asked NATO and its allies to ban Ukraine and former Soviet nations from joining the alliance, and called on NATO to scale back activities in Eastern Europe.Kyiv and Western countries have said these were baseless pretexts for an “imperial-style land grab” in Ukraine.‘Decision must be made’Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday there was “no alternative” but for the West to give Ukraine battle tanks.“The partners are principled in their attitude – they will support Ukraine as much as is necessary for our victory,” said Zelenskyy in his evening address.“Yes, we will still have to fight for the supply of modern tanks, but every day, we make it more obvious that there is no alternative, that a decision about tanks must be made.“The only thing worth emphasising in all this is the time, the delivery time. Each arrangement must be carried out as quickly as possible – for our defence.”US defence chief Lloyd Austin urged allies to step up support for Ukraine.“Russia is regrouping, recruiting, and trying to re-equip,” he said at the start of the Ramstein meeting. “This is not a moment to slow down. It’s a time to dig deeper. The Ukrainian people are watching us.”The US announced an additional $2.5bn in military aid for Ukraine on Thursday, a package that will include more armoured vehicles and ammunition.Finland announced a new donation of more than 400 million euros ($434m) worth of defence equipment for Ukraine, not including the German-made Leopard 2 tanks, which it said it could also send if there is an agreement with allies.Poland said will provide Ukraine with additional Soviet-made T-72 tanks and some infantry vehicles.“We must do everything to help Ukraine so the war does not spill over to NATO territory,” defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak said.The influx of new weapons, tanks, and armoured carriers comes as Ukraine has faced intense combat in the country’s east around the city of Bakhmut. The battles are expected to intensify in the coming months.",0.07068,0.50042,5024,21,6,7,0,2
200,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/20/russias-atrocities-in-ukraine-rehearsed-in-chechnya,"Kyiv, Ukraine – As Maryam watched an online video recorded in Ukraine of a Russian attack, the memories came flooding back.She heard the wailing of a diving Russian plane, and yanked the headphones out of her ears, peeked at the sky above her and fell on the floor in shock.“I haven’t heard this sound since the war,” Maryam, a Chechen refugee settled in a Western country, told Al Jazeera by phone.She withheld her last name and other personal information because she still has family in Chechnya.It was not just the sound.The way Russian missiles, bombs and artillery appeared to deliberately target residential areas and the accusations and evidence that Russian soldiers tortured and killed civilians in occupied territories reminded Maryam of what she and many Chechens went through.Human rights groups and analysts have said the brutality and alleged war crimes in Ukraine, a nation of more than 40 million, began in Chechnya, a mountainous, Qatar-sized province whose current population is 1.5 million.“In this war, many observers see echoes of previous atrocities under [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera.“Especially for Chechens, the indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure is reminiscent of the attacks on [Chechnya’s administrative capital of] Grozny in 1999,” he said.The Kremlin’s military strategies and tactics used in Ukraine were tried and tested in Chechnya, military analysts said.“Possibly, the most important thing is that [in Chechnya] the Russian army and law enforcement really got used to warring and killing,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a historian with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.Even the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979-1989, let alone previous military conflicts communist Moscow had taken part in, were not massive enough for such practices to take root, he said.For decades, the Soviet military mostly had theoretical knowledge about warfare – and imitated it during drills.“And here – a direct experience all or almost all land and air force units were involved in” both Chechen wars, Mitrokhin said.Dark ageMaryam was a teenager when the first Chechen war began in 1994.It killed tens of thousands of civilians and ended with Chechnya’s de facto independence from Moscow in 1996.In 1999, newly appointed Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin launched the second invasion of Chechnya – or, as he called it, an “anti-terrorist operation”.For many Chechens, these years were a throwback to the dark ages.Maryam’s family lived in a basement without electricity and running water, and she had to carry endless buckets from the well and chop firewood for heating and cooking.“I don’t even remember my first love,” she said. “War, war, everywhere [was] war, the war that became part of daily life, the main thing in your life.”The new invasion pitted Chechens against each other, caused tens of thousands of deaths and “returned” the North Caucasus province to under Moscow’s thumb.Moscow convinced Muslim scholar Akhmad Kadyrov to switch sides and become Chechnya’s leader.After his 2004 killing, it installed his son Ramzan, a bullnecked boxing enthusiast as head of the Chechen Republic.Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov [File: Chingis Kondarov/Reuters]In Ukraine, the Kremlin also wanted to install a more pro-Moscow leader as president.As its plans to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government failed, Moscow appointed Russia-friendly Ukrainians to govern occupied areas.But they were rejected by the general population, while some were assassinated by Ukrainian intelligence and rebel fighters.“An attempt to find a ‘Ukrainian Kadyrov’ failed,” Sergey Bizyukin, a fugitive Russian opposition activist, told Al Jazeera.“And that was of critical importance. Essentially, [first Russian President Boris] Yeltsin and Putin lost the war in Chechnya, but won the ‘special operation’ after finding a vassal,” he said.Brainwashing both sidesMaryam fled the rule of Ramzan Kadyrov, whose henchmen still abduct, torture and kill critics, alleged “radicals” and their families, according to survivors, witnesses and rights groups.The sound of the Russian plane in the video made her suppressed horrors come back.“It was so horrible that I couldn’t get a grip for about 20 minutes. The flashback was so strong,” she said.And she was angry at average Russians, analysts and journalists who say they could not possibly imagine that Russian servicemen in Ukraine were capable of atrocities.“And a million people [in Chechnya] who went through this hell sit and listen to Russians tearing their hair and saying, ‘Oh God, how did we allow this to happen,’” she said.The second Chechen war also restarted the Kremlin propaganda machine.“Russian control comes together with a lot of militant propaganda,” a Russian human rights advocate who documented the war crimes in Chechnya told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.In 2013, Valery Gerasimov, who now leads the Russian invasion in Ukraine, published his views on the doctrine of “hybrid wars” postulating that modern conflicts need ideological elements to target civilian populations on both sides.For years, propaganda demonising “radicals” and glorifying Russia’s “peacemaking” corroded hearts and minds – even among Chechens with firsthand experience of the wars.“What I know from my Chechen friends is that they are in shock at how many people around [them] actually believe in this propaganda after everything they’ve lived through,” the advocate said.Russia began replicating the pattern in Ukraine right after annexing Crimea in 2014 as the Kremlin began to vilify local Muslims.“They will turn us into a second Chechnya,” a Crimean Tatar Muslim, said in March 2014.Within weeks, he had to flee to mainland Ukraine as Moscow-installed authorities began arresting and jailing Muslims around him – and branding them “radicals” and “terrorists”.Death from aboveIn Chechnya, Moscow also “pioneered” its use of ballistic missiles on civilian areas.On October 21, 1999, they hit an outdoor market, a maternity hospital and a mosque in Grozny, killing 118 and wounding more than 400.For many more weeks, Grozny was shelled with artillery, now-internationally banned cluster bombs, and cruise missiles that killed thousands and razed the city to the ground.Then, small infantry groups moved in, shooting at anyone in sight, according to survivors and media reports.Tens of thousands of people were killed during the Chechen wars [File: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP]Colonel Alexander Dvornikov led a motor rifle division there – and 22 years later, between last April and June, served as chief commander of Russian forces in Ukraine.Many more officers battle-tested in Chechnya are now among Russia’s top brass.Even some Chechen rebels who had joined Kadyrov now fight in Ukraine – although with very mixed results.‘Clean-ups’Grozny fell on February 6, 2000, boosting Putin’s approval ratings and paving the way for his election as president a month later.And as Russia was establishing control over Chechnya in the early 2000s, federal forces began mass-murdering civilians.On February 5, 2000, riot police from St Petersburg, Putin’s hometown, executed 56 civilians in the town of Novye Aldy.“They just got in and shot dead whomever they wanted,” the advocate said.Russian forces systematically “cleaned up” residential areas to detain, torture or kill disloyal locals and terrorise the survivors.Those “clean-ups” still fill Maryam with dread.“The war itself was not as horrible as the clean-ups,” she recalled.For years, human rights groups documented the “clean-ups” and their consequences – and can now compare them with what happened in Ukraine.“Russia’s attack on Ukraine finally puts these horrors into context, and when the war is finally over, historians will surely see patterns stretching across all of Putin’s wars, as well as other human rights disasters under his leadership,” Norwegian Helsinki Committee’s Dale said.",0.04567,0.31887,8042,13,21,24,6,1
201,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/20/russia-claims-capture-of-village-near-ukraines-bakhmut,"Russia says it has taken control of an eastern Ukrainian village near Bakhmut, a city where fighting has been raging for months.The Russian Ministry of Defence said in a war update on Friday that its forces had seized Klishchiivka, a village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.Klishchiivka, which had a pre-war population of about 400 people, was captured by ground forces aided by artillery and air support, the ministry said.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.The village sits about 9km (6 miles) south of Bakhmut, a strategically important city that Russian units, supported by mercenaries from the Wagner Group, have fought to take from Ukrainian soldiers in some of the war’s bloodiest battles.Both the Wagner Group and Russia-backed separatist forces in Donetsk, fighting under the banner of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, had claimed to have seized control of Klishchiivka before the defence ministry’s statement. The ministry said its forces had also taken control of the village of Lobkove in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region.Zaporizhia and Donetsk are two of four regions in Ukraine’s east and south partly occupied by Russia that President Vladimir Putin moved to unilaterally annex in September.Ukraine’s allies weigh whether to send tanksRussia made its claims of battlefield advances as Ukraine’s Western allies met in Germany to discuss boosting their military support.The talks at the Ramstein Air Base follow Ukrainian warnings that Russia is seeking to re-energise its invasion following a string of setbacks in recent months.The United States and Finland announced new military aid ahead of the meeting, where the main focus was on whether Germany would allow armies across Europe to send German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressing the meeting via video link, thanked allies for their support but said more aid is needed quickly.“We have to speed up,” Zelenskyy said. “Time must become our weapon. The Kremlin must lose.”The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told reporters in Madrid that some European countries were ready to send heavy tanks and that he hoped a decision to do so would be taken.Berlin has veto power over any decision to export its tanks from countries that use them, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government appears to be reluctant, fearing such a move would provoke Russia.Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from the meeting, said whether Germany sends its Leopard 2 tanks is a “million-dollar question”.“The one key thing that Ukraine really wants and it says it needs, the Leopard 2 tanks, has not been mentioned so far as a contribution by Germany,” Vaessen said.Germany’s new defence chief, Boris Pistorius, told reporters no decision had yet been made on the tanks.",0.04126,0.38432,2803,8,4,8,1,2
202,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/20/mapping-the-battle-for-bakhmut,"The front-line city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been the focus of intense fighting for months.Battles became fiercer this week, but Ukraine’s forces appear to be holding out against the Russians, who recently claimed to have seized the nearby salt-mining town of Soledar – a victory Kyiv denies.If Russian forces or the Wagner mercenaries who are also fighting in eastern Ukraine, or indeed both manage to capture Bakhmut, its fall would mark Moscow’s most significant victory after months of humiliating setbacks.The city, famed for its wine-making, is symbolically relevant for Ukrainians for whom “Hold Bakhmut” is now a popular slogan.Plumes of smoke rise from a Russian strike in the front-line city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine on January 7, 2023, during a 36-hour ceasefire over Orthodox Christmas declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin [Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters]Bakhmut’s pre-war population was about 70,000. Today, an estimated 2,000 civilians remain in the city; many are surviving in squalid conditions as the conflict rages.Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting about a kilometre away from Bakhmut, said residents occasionally risk their lives to reach a volunteer centre in the heart of the city to get hot food and drinks.“There has been no water supply in the city since October and no electricity since August,” he said.Russia’s focus on BakhmutAfter Russian forces captured the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region in June and July, Moscow began a ruthless offensive on Bakhmut in the neighbouring Donetsk region.It has used familiar tactics, advancing with destructive ground attacks on settlements south of the city.In late July, Moscow made territorial gains around Bakhmut and Avdiivka, taking control of the Vuhlehirska Thermal Power Plant southeast of Bakhmut. Russia also seized Ukrainian barricades around the Butivka coal mine southwest of Avdiivka after Ukraine’s withdrawal from the area.By August, Russian forces and mercenaries with the Wagner Group were pressing towards Bakhmut with increased air attacks and shelling. Wagner Group mercenaries also broke through Ukrainian defences on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut.By October, Russian troops were able to penetrate Bakhmut’s northeastern and southern suburbs, but they were ultimately forced out by Ukrainian counterattacks.Escalation in winterBy November, as Bakhmut endured incessant barrages of Russian artillery, the battle had turned into trench warfare, and hundreds of people were reported dead and injured every day on both sides.Kyiv said Russia was suffering heavy losses and that many of those killed belonged to the Wagner Group. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner chief, offered to pardon convicts if they joined the group and fought for six months. Since Prigozhin’s offer, some have been released.As neither side made significant gains, civilians were forced to take shelter in basements prone to flooding.By the end of November, Russian forces had advanced on Bakhmut’s southern front, capturing settlements such as Ozarianivka, a village 15km (9 miles) southwest of the city.Even so, according to the Institute for the Study of War at the time, Russian advances were unlikely to generate “operational-level effects”.On December 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bakhmut, where he urged Ukrainian fighters to maintain their morale.Capture of SoledarOn January 13, Moscow said its forces had seized control of the nearby Ukrainian salt-mining town of Soledar after weeks of intense battles.The Russian Ministry of Defence said the capture was possible because of Moscow’s “constant bombardment of the enemy” using missiles, artillery and aircraft.Kyiv denies Soledar has been captured and says Ukrainian troops are holding out.The Russian ministry said control of Soledar would allow its forces to cut off Ukraine’s supply lines in Bakhmut and then “block and encircle the Ukrainian units there”.Taking Bakhmut would also open up a route for Russian forces to press on towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, Ukrainian strongholds in the Donbas region, which Moscow hopes to take control of in its entirety.Speaking to Al Jazeera in Bakhmut, a Ukrainian soldier who identified himself as Sergey, said Russian ground forces had launched massive attacks against Kyiv’s positions in recent months.“They send their troops in like waves,” Sergey said. “We cannot stop them every time because we have fewer guys, and unfortunately, we have lost a lot of men.”On his visit to the front line, Zelenskyy said Russia had also suffered many casualties: “The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes. This is what madness looks like.”Described as one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, the battle for Bakhmut continues.(Al Jazeera)",0.0335,0.40967,4826,6,6,18,1,2
