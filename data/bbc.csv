Too low and you can be shot down by machine gun fire - too high and you can be detected by enemy air defence systems. For helicopter pilots in war-time Ukraine, there is little margin for error. Just ask Roman. He has flown countless combat missions for Ukraine´s Sikorsky Brigade and been decorated for valour. He tells us his age - 34 - but not his last name.  ""The closer to the target, the lower we fly. It´s one or two metres above ground,"" he tells the BBC. ""It´s not enough just to strike the target. You have to come back safe and bring your crew and helicopter back safely for the next mission.""  Over the past year some of his fellow pilots have not made it back.We were given rare access to Ukraine´s war in the skies at an air strip on a patch of open ground. We can´t say where it is - if Russia could identify the location, it would be a major target. Image caption, Roman onboard the helicopterWe watch Roman take off for his latest sortie on Ukraine´s eastern front with our camera in the cockpit. His helicopter is followed by two others; their blades slice the air beneath a muddy grey sky.  Below them a Ukrainian trench zigzags across the landscape, and a village lies deserted. They speed across a frozen lake as if skating on ice. Half an hour later they return, having unleashed 80 missiles.    Roman comes in to land circling low enough over our heads for us to see him wave from the window. He´s renowned among fellow airmen in his brigade for executing difficult manoeuvres - a Ukrainian top gun in an ageing Soviet aircraft.  His Mi-8 helicopter is about as old as he is, and lacks heavy armour, or modern warning systems about incoming missiles.  Every mission could be his last.""Of course, there is some risk,"" he says after touching down. ""I just don´t think about this. If it happens, it will not be my problem, it will be a problem for my relatives"". It sounds like a joke, but his expression is concealed by his balaclava.Image caption, The helicopter fires missiles during a sortie in eastern UkraineHe will not disclose his target, but chances are it was close to the eastern city of Bakhmut - which the Russians are battling to encircle.""It was just an ordinary mission. You concentrate 100% on your task,"" he says. ""You think of your guys waiting for you on the ground. They are really striving if they call for aviation."" What he doesn´t think about is the Russian troops on the receiving end.   ""If they came here with war,"" he tells me, ""we are just protecting our country. We are not aggressors.  We are the victim. And if to win this war we should kill Russian soldiers, we are ready to kill them all.""The challenges of giving fighter jets to UkraineWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?As soon as the helicopters land, maintenance crews converge, refuelling and rearming the aircraft to be ready for the next flight.The missiles are loaded by hand. One is inscribed with a crude message to Russian troops. Within minutes Roman has co-ordinates for a new target and is wheels up again. He says Ukraine can´t win this war with the Soviet equipment it´s got. Image caption, The helicopter on the ground in eastern UkraineA spokesman for his brigade spells it out.  ""We need new helicopters with navigation equipment, high precision weapons and ammunition,"" he tells us. ""We need everything.""Add this to the fighter jets already requested by President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it´s a long list for what may be a long war. When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded last year, Roman was part of a Ukrainian peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now this former peacekeeper sees a danger of endless conflict with Russia.""Just look back at our history,"" he says. ""We have always had problems with our neighbour. When we win this one if they don´t change, they will come back to attack us again, in years or in decades.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warMore on this storyWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?4 days agoWest sends Ukraine mixed messages on war planes31 JanuaryZelensky takes fighter jet bid to EU leaders9 FebruaryThe challenges of giving fighter jets to Ukraine10 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished12 minutes agoHow Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuckPublished8 hours agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´5More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck6Spectacular northern lights seen across UK7Multiverse drama sweeps SAG Awards ahead of Oscars8Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandal9Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment10Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong modelBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Within a few days Russian troops attacking from Crimea had seized an area of Ukrainian territory bigger than Switzerland. Ukrainian authorities are yet to explain what went wrong in the south in those early days. To help uncover what happened, the BBC has spoken to military officers, politicians and activists.On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine´s security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president´s life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.But Ukraine´s leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as ""manipulation"" and called on everyone to remain calm.Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. ""We expected it on 22 February,"" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia´s initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. ""Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.""Image caption, This secret map dating back to 1989 was seized from a Russian commander and shows the attack plan around KyivIf the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow´s plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: ""But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.""The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine´s general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia´s invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine´s defence.Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.Image caption, Ukrainian intelligence expected the full-scale invasion two days before it happened, says Oleksiy DanilovThat indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.""How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?"" Lt Palchenko explains. ""Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.""Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv´s defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. BBCWe stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose upMaj Gen Dmytro MarchenkoUkrainian militaryWhen Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. ""When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn´t put together a map,"" he said.  He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. ""My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.""  Image source, Maj Gen MarchenkoImage caption, Hastily organised Ukrainian defenders blew up bridges around Mykolaiv, halting the Russian invadersThe Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country´s top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.""[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,"" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. ""We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank ´hedgehogs´ - in half a day, it was all done.""Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.""We stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose up,"" he adds.Additional reporting by Anna Tsyba.Related TopicsUkrainian governmentRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaCrimeaUkraineMore on this storyHow Russia´s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failure5 days agoHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?3 days agoWhy so many Russians turn a blind eye to war5 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished3 minutes agoHow Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuckPublished8 hours agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?Designing for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyFive must-haves for reporting from the red carpet.

It never happened.In a few hours, the 13-year-old Ukrainian´s simple plan became the impossible.Overnight, Ukraine was invaded by Russia and now Yároslav has no idea when he will ever kick a ball with his friends again. His school friends are scattered across the globe and he is living in one room in a Scottish hotel with his mother Oléna Bólotova.The hotel has been their home for eight months.Dad Oleksii is still at home in Kharkiv, northeast Ukraine, as are Oléna´s parents.Oléna told BBC Scotland everything changed overnight.Image caption, A city hotel has been home for Oléna and Yároslav for the last eight months""No one expected that one morning they had to wake up, bring all they have in one small backpack and run away,"" she said.""Kharkiv is 36km (22 miles) from the Russian border. The full invasion happened at 05:00 on 24 February 2022 and we had to flee to escape the war.""We tried to settle in different regions of Ukraine - but it wasn´t easy and there are no safe places in Ukraine right now - there are no schools, electricity problems, we were scared about winter. ""We were scared for the future and for our children so I took my child and crossed the border.""Ukraine orphans enjoy ´paradise´ in ScotlandThe wounded Ukraine soldier being treated in ScotlandUkrainians share last photo taken before lives changed foreverIt is a story which almost 23,500 Ukrainians are living after coming to Scotland on the Scottish government´s super sponsor scheme. Some were housed on cruise ships, some in hotels and others were taken in by host families.While the war rages on at home, Oléna believes the thousands of Ukrainian mothers who left the country to find safety are a different kind of soldier, fighting to keep their children safe.""It was almost impossible to make the decision because all my life was in Ukraine,"" she said. ""I had my husband, a family, a job, a house a dog, and a lot of plans for our future lives. ""We were adult people with strong ideas of our future and how to raise our child in Ukraine. ""War destroyed all plans and hopes for the future. When we needed to escape it wasn´t easy for any Ukrainian families.""Image source, Oléna BólotovaImage caption, As a family, Oleksii, Oléna and Yároslav had plans for the future but now live day-to-dayFor those left behind life is difficult. ""People try to settle into living a new reality,"" said Oléna. ""Living in bomb shelters and trying to live as normally as they can. Going to jobs.""New children are born in Ukraine so Ukraine is alive, Ukraine is fighting - teachers trying to provide online teaching everywhere even when there is no electricity. ""My husband is in Ukraine - he cannot join us. We have been married almost 18 years and this is the first time in our life we separated.""Men are trying to live a new reality without wives and children.""Now 13, Yároslav enjoys school in Glasgow and he has joined a football team. His English is improving despite his friends´ strong accents.He said it was painful to reflect. ""I remember on 23 February 2022 I told my friends we are going to play football tomorrow and go to school. ""And on 24 February at 05:00, I woke up and I wasn´t thinking about school.""He said it was hard to keep in touch at first.""They were in shelters with no internet. But then I call and text them and they are safe. ""Now my friends are in different parts of the world. Some in Poland, some in countries like Indonesia, I am shocked at which places. Some are still in Kharkiv in the very dangerous area.""´Ukrainians all our lives´He speaks to his dad every day. Oléna tries to speak to her parents every day but worries about them.Her biggest hope is to see in the news that the war is over. But for now, they would like more permanent accommodation. Oléna is grateful she feels safe but she would like to cook her son a meal, do her own laundry and to have their own space.A university lecturer and academic in Ukraine, Oléna has started a job at a city university doing admin.""I am happy that I can bring something here and become a tax payer here. I feel like a real part of this Glasgow community,"" she added.Until the mother and son can return to Ukraine, they say they will be brave - a word Oléna said was used a lot to describe Ukrainians. ""Not only for the soldiers who fight on the front line, but for every Ukrainian woman who takes her children and tries to look around the world for a safe place to raise them,"" she said.""Brave for teachers and doctors who stay in Ukraine and help people. Brave for everyone who is Ukrainian.""Ukraine is always inside of us.

The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky´s call for a summit with Mr Xi.Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. ""We share Beijing´s views,"" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Beijing was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""I´ve seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,"" he added.China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC´s World Affairs Editor John Simpson. The Chinese proposals follow a visit by the country´s top diplomat Wang Yi to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China´s state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to ""deepen political trust"" and ""strengthen strategic coordination"" with Moscow.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineWestern officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing ""doesn´t have much credibility"" because it had ""not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine"".President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine´s north, east and south.But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsAt a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory ""will inevitably await us"" if allies ""respect their promises and deadlines"".Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after many nations in those continents abstained during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion. ""We didn´t work well for many years, we didn´t pay attention, I think it´s a big mistake,"" he said.Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.""What I saw. It was horrible,"" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.How Putin´s fate is tied to his war in UkraineChina´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.The White House´s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.Moldova is Europe´s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.It comes days after US President Joe Biden flew to Kyiv for a surprise visit and held talks with Mr Zelensky.On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions on technology that has a civilian and military dual use.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingVolodymyr ZelenskyChinaMoldovaUkraineMore on this storyHow Putin´s fate is tied to his war in Ukraine3 days agoHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?3 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished31 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Now Beijing has given its firmest response yet - and it´s not something many in the West would like.In recent days, China has launched an assertive charm offensive, kicking off with top diplomat Wang Yi´s tour of Europe, which culminated in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Beijing has released not one but two position papers - the first offering the Chinese solution to the war, and the other outlining a plan for world peace. These largely retread China´s talking points from the past year, calling for respect for sovereignty (for Ukraine) and the protection of national security interests (for Russia), while opposing the use of unilateral sanctions (by the US). The West may come away unimpressed - but convincing them was never likely the main goal for Beijing.China´s goal: send a clear message to USFirstly, it clearly seeks to position itself as a global peacemaker. An obvious clue about who it´s really trying to charm lies in one of its papers, where it mentions engaging South East Asia, Africa and South America - the so-called Global South. In preaching an alternative vision to a US-led world order, it is wooing the rest of the globe, which is watching to see how the West handles the Ukraine crisis.But another goal is to send a clear message to the US. ""There is an element of defiance,"" said Alexander Korolev, an expert in Sino-Russian ties at the University of New South Wales. ""It is signalling: ´If things get ugly between us, I have someone to go to. Russia is not alone, which means that I will not be alone when there is a confrontation… don´t get comfortable in bullying me.´""The timing, say observers, is a giveaway. Relations between the US and China have hit a new low, exacerbated by the spy balloon saga. Some have also questioned why China - if its intention is to help end the war - is only just now making its big diplomatic push for Ukraine peace.""China had ample opportunities to display leadership, it was invited early on to contribute to ending the war… If the goal was to truly display the image of a global leader, you don´t have to sit on the fence for one year and try to perform a diplomatic dance,"" said Dr Korolev.There was a third goal, and it could be seen in Mr Wang´s itinerary. By visiting France, Germany, Italy and Hungary, whose leaders China perceives as taking less of a hardline stance on Russia, Mr Wang may have been testing the waters to see if China could lure some of Europe into China´s orbit.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsBeijing sees a ""logical convergence of interests"" with these countries, said Zhang Xin, an international political economy expert with the East China Normal University in Shanghai. ""It believes the US has hegemonic power, and that a large part of the Transatlantic world could benefit from detaching from that system.""But whether China will succeed in that particular goal is questionable. Mr Wang´s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he criticised the US, did not play well in a roomful of America´s staunchest allies and, according to diplomats, only spawned greater distrust of China´s true motives.His tour ""was a very overt push to say: ´We don´t have problems with Europe, we have problems with the US, we can fix things with you Europeans and you need to understand that the US is leading you down a problematic road´"", said Andrew Small, a senior fellow specialising in Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank.""But I think in most places in Europe, this message doesn´t have much traction.""Zelensky wants to meet Xi Jinping to discuss peace planThe key question now is whether Beijing will live up to its word of making peace as it tightens its embrace of Russia. The US has warned this week that China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia, and that Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.Publicly China has reacted with angry rhetoric. But behind closed doors, Mr Wang made it clear to top EU official Josep Borrell that it will not provide weapons to Russia.Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Mr Wang in MoscowAccording to Mr Borrell, Mr Wang had also asked: ""Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms to Russia when you are providing arms to Ukraine?"" It is a revealing line, say observers, showing that Beijing still truly believes the West is to blame for fuelling the war. ""Sending weapons to any warring party is considered as further escalation - that is the position of the Chinese state so far,"" said Dr Zhang.There is scepticism that Beijing would supply weapons to Moscow, given how it runs counter to Chinese interests.Such a move would be seen by others as a clear escalation of the war, and would lead to sanctions and disruption of trade with the West - hugely damaging for China, as the EU and US are among its top trading partners. It would also raise global tensions significantly and likely push US allies further into Washington´s embrace, stymieing Beijing´s plan to woo some of them away. What is more likely to happen, say observers, is that Beijing will continue or even step up indirect support to Russia, such as boosting economic trade - which has provided a financial lifeline to Moscow - and abstaining from sanctions on Russia.What support is China giving Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?They may even supply more dual-use technology through third party states such as Iran or North Korea, according to Dr Small, so that they can lend support ""as deniably as possible"".But as the war drags on, the issue of giving lethal weapons will resurface, he warned. ""There hasn´t been a question yet on what kind of significant things China could be asked to do, because previously Russia didn´t need to resupply,"" said Dr Small.

It called for the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and a halt to fighting.The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.In Vienna, a large number of delegates walked out during a Russian address at a parliamentary session of a European security body.The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) walkout and the UN vote came a day before the first anniversary of the invasion. The UN vote called for peace as soon as possible. The resolution reaffirmed support for Ukraine´s sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any Russian claims to the parts of the country it occupies. In September, MPs in Moscow voted to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine. The UN also demanded ""that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders"" and called for a cessation of hostilities. The measure is not legally binding but holds political weight.While the resolution was passed overwhelmingly by the majority of nations, there were some notable abstentions.China, India, Iran and South Africa were among the 32 countries to abstain in the vote. The seven countries who voted against were Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the vote ""made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine´s territorial integrity must be restored"".""One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong,"" he tweeted.Has Putin´s war failed?Earlier at the OSCE in Vienna, the decision to give visas to the Russian delegation caused anger.Ukraine and Lithuania boycotted the session entirely over Austria´s decision to invite officials from Moscow, despite some being under EU sanctions. The Austrian government said it was obliged to do so under international law because the OSCE has its headquarters there. Latvian MP Rihards Kols described the Russian presence as the ""elephant in the room"", adding it was a ""disgrace"" that they were allowed to take part.A large number of delegates then staged a walkout during the Russian address.The Russian delegate, Vladimir Dzhabarov, derided delegates for walking out, repeating false claims that Russia´s invasion of Ukraine was a battle against nationalists and Nazis who Moscow claims are leading the Kyiv government. The OSCE was founded in 1975 to improve relations between the Western and Eastern blocs. Its current members include members of Nato and allies of Russia.President Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022 in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two.The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to a UN estimate, with the real number likely to be much higher.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: UN Chief condemns Ukraine war in special meetingRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUnited NationsUkraineMore on this storyHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?3 days agoTen photos before Ukrainian lives changed forever4 days agoUN chief condemns Ukraine war ahead of anniversary4 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished31 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Neighbours found her body on 11 March and placed her into a cold garage before they had to flee. Months went by before Prof Kirilenko was able to get an update.Image source, Andrei KirilenkoImage caption, Andrei Kirilenko´s 85-year-old mother, Svetlana, who died in Ukraine last year.Mrs Kirilenko lived in the key port city, in the eastern Donbas region, which faced some of the heaviest Russian bombardment.  In their last conversation in early March Prof Kirilenko said he believed his mother knew she was saying goodbye for the last time. Image source, Andrei KirilenkoImage caption, Prof Kirilenko said this photo was taken of his mother the year she went to college in Kharkiv, in UkraineHe later received a phone call from his homeland to say his mother had died and had been buried. ""It´s dangerous for people in Ukraine to get in touch with anyone who doesn´t have a Russian phone number but they managed to communicate that some of them managed to go back, burying my mum somewhere.""There are satellite photos which show the city of Mariupol basically surrounded by fields of mass graves because hundreds of thousands of people died,"" he said.  ""So somewhere in one of those graves is my mum.""The professor of finance at the Cambridge Judge Business School said seeing people queue for miles to see Queen Elizabeth II lying in state last year stirred emotions about the loss of his own mother. He said: ""In some way it was pageantry but in some way, a very human experience and I haven´t gone through that, so the chapter hasn´t finished for me,"" he said.""That remains painful and not just for me. Mine is the story of millions of people.""Image source, ReutersImage caption, Prof Kirilenko does not know where his mother is buriedOn the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, Prof Kirilenko spoke of his fears that the war will continue to drag on.  ""What we´re seeing is that both sides are arming more, fighting more and more people are dying.""[The Russian administration has] gone and recruited hundreds of thousands of their own citizens and sent some of them unprepared into battle,"" he said. ""It´s a meatgrinder. I don´t even know what it´s for. These are old wealthy man. What do they win? ""They´re not going to get any younger, or any more money out of this... in fact they´re losing money, "" he added.  ""They are not going to get more glory out of this because everyone thinks of them as evil people.""

Prof Kirilenko called for the economic strategy to be ""designed by Ukrainians"", adding: ""It´s your country.

""It´s not my home, not my country, but I´m making a new life here,"" says 23-year-old Nikita Vikhorev.Image caption, Nikita Vikhorev, Yuliia Kuznetsova, Arina Koroletska, Oleksandra Shuliatieva and Andrii Barannik (l-r) all left their homes in Ukraine after Russia´s invasion""Sometimes I can´t believe that I´m living in London, I can visit Westminster or I can go to Kings Cross and see the Platform 9 ¾,"" he smiles, referring to the fictional part of the railway station from the Harry Potter series.Unlike most Ukrainian men, Nikita was able to leave the country and avoid being conscripted due to the efforts of the London Performing Academy of Music (LPMAM). After war began the academy worked hard to bring over 50 Ukrainian music students to safety and offered bursaries, enabling them to continue their studies.Male students like Nikita and singer and guitarist Andrii Barannik were provided with legal letters by LPMAM requesting military exemption.Without these, they would have been banned from leaving Ukraine and likely called up to fight on the front line.Image caption, Nikita is a talented violinist, originally from the city of Odessa""My dad said to me you can go to the army or you can go to the UK,"" Andrii explains.The 21-year-old´s father is a soldier fighting in Ukraine and his mother and sister are still there too, in their hometown of Kharkiv, close to the border with Russia.He says he decided to move to ""try to continue our culture"", but adds ""it was a hard decision"" to make.""At night, I lie on my bed and think about young guys, they´re fighting on the front,"" he says, covering his face with his hands at the thought.Image caption, Andrii´s family are back in Kharkiv, close to the border with RussiaNikita also worries about what has happened to the people he knew back home. One of his friends who is fighting in Ukraine was taken prisoner in Mariupol last March.""We don´t know where he is, we have no information, he is a prisoner of Russians and I know absolutely nothing,"" he says.How does he feel then, about being here in London instead of on the battlefield?""I know I can´t fight, so my violin is my weapon,"" he explains.""My mission is to use my music to help people to care about Ukraine.""Image source, London Performing Academy of MusicImage caption, Nikita was able to continue his studies in LondonAnother refugee who is interested in spreading Ukrainian culture is 20-year-old Arina Koroletska.She is currently living in temporary accommodation with her mother and sister, who she left Ukraine with.A singer, Arina is continuing her studies in music and has found opportunities to perform through a Ukrainian social club in Twickenham.The club was first set up in Prosperity, a Ukrainian restaurant in the area, and has since expanded and moved into a local church hall where it hosts classes and activities for all ages.The group meets every Friday afternoon and Arina leads the choir there, singing British and Ukrainian songs. Image source, Ukrainian social club TwickenhamImage caption, Arina (third from right) leads the choir at the social club set up for Ukrainian refugees in the Twickenham area""I´m very happy here"", she says, ""we perform, we try to show English people our culture.""Seventeen-year-old Oleksandra Shuliatieva also attends and takes part in traditional Ukrainian folk dance. She says it has helped her to make friends and find new opportunities.""I want to be a dancer,"" she says. ""We do lots of performances, meet lots of people, try to give a good mood.""Oleksandra is from Horenka, a small village close to Kyiv. She´s been told 70% of the buildings there have been destroyed.""When I saw this, I felt horrible… This is my home and I don´t want to leave it.""Image caption, Oleksandra has made new friends in London, and has been pursuing her studies as well as finding a jobShe has relatives in the military, and says she´s ""so proud"" of her uncle and cousin who are ""protecting the country"".But she misses her dad, who remained in Ukraine and she considers to be her ""best friend"".Speaking about how things have changed since February 2022, she says she´s staying positive and embracing her new life in the UK capital.""I´ve found new friends, a job, a city that´s not like my home, but it´s OK to stay for now,"" she says.Image source, Oleksandra ShuliatievaImage caption, Oleksandra is from Horenka, a village near Kyiv which has been heavily bombardedFor Yuliia Kuznetsova, settling into a new life in London has been ""not difficult, but different"".The 25-year-old was living in Lviv with her husband and had a job she loved, when war broke out.""Life as we knew it ended on 24 February, it´s never going to be the same,"" she says.She has been living with a sponsor since she arrived in the UK last April, and is planning to move into her own place.""I do miss home, but at the same time I have to remember that the home I miss doesn´t exist anymore,"" she adds.Image source, Yuliia KuznetsovaImage caption, Yuliia came to the UK on the Homes for Ukraine schemeWhen the war first broke out Yuliia says she didn´t want to leave, despite the anxiety caused by constant air raid sirens and time spent in bomb shelters during the first month of the war. But her family decided that one person should ""go abroad, to a safer place, and try to settle down"", to continue the family line.Meanwhile her mother remained in Ukraine, and her father and husband are fighting on the front line. Despite everything they´ve had to leave behind, this group are full of hopes for the future. The musicians want to continue to share their culture, and alongside dancing, Oleksandra says she has dreams of starting a Ukrainian restaurant.""If you do the restaurant I will come all the time and play the music,"" Andrii tells her, before adding: ""And eat a lot of borscht!""Watch the full interview on BBC Three´s The Catch Up.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But India has resisted the pressure and continued with its strategy of not criticising Russia directly. It has abstained from similar resolutions both at the UNGA and at the UNSC in the past. The two countries have a decades-old trusted relationship since the Cold War. Russia is also India´s largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped in recent years largely due to Delhi´s decision to boost domestic defence manufacturing and a widening imports portfolio.The two countries also have a history of diplomatic co-operation - Moscow has vetoed UNSC resolutions over the disputed region of Kashmir.Delhi, however, has talked about the importance of ""the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"" in its past statements on Ukraine.

The meeting was debating a motion backed by Ukraine and its allies demanding Russia pull out immediately and unconditionally.Ukraine hopes that by supporting the motion countries will show solidarity.The Kremlin has accused the West of wanting to defeat Russia at any cost. Vasily Nebenzya, the Kremlin´s ambassador to the UN, said the US and its allies were prepared to plunge the entire world into war.Russian President Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022 in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two. The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to a UN estimate, but that number is likely to be much higher.The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where mass executions are alleged to have taken place, estimated in April that 21,000 people had died there alone.  Russia and Ukraine have each seen at least 100,000 of their soldiers killed or injured, according to the US military.   More than 13 million people were made refugees abroad or displaced inside Ukraine.Mr Putin´s claim that his operation was needed to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine, a country with historic ties to Russia, was dismissed by Ukraine and its allies as a ruse for an unprovoked attack.""That invasion is an affront to our collective conscience,"" Mr Guterres told the General Assembly. ""It is a violation of the United Nations Charter and international law."" The possible consequences of a ""spiralling conflict"" were, he said, a ""clear and present danger"".Mr Guterres said the war was ""fanning regional instability and fuelling global tensions and divisions, while diverting attention and resources from other crises and pressing global issues"".There had, he said, been ""implicit threats to use nuclear weapons"".""It is high time to step back from the brink,"" he said.""Complacency will only deepen the crisis, while further eroding our shared principles proclaimed in the Charter. War is not the solution. War is the problem. People in Ukraine are suffering enormously. Ukrainians, Russians and people far beyond need peace.""Sixty countries have sponsored the resolution, which stresses ""the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.""The UN is likely to approve the resolution, which is not legally binding but carries political weight. However, it is unlikely that the vote will have much influence on Russia´s actions in Ukraine. Voting will take place later on Thursday, the eve of the invasion´s first anniversary. Over the past year, the General Assembly has voted on similar resolutions opposing Russia´s invasion. In October 143 member states voted to condemn Moscow´s illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine. Russia, Belarus, Syria, and North Korea opposed the motion, while India and China were among the 35 states that abstained.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Battle for the city of Bakhmut intensifiesMr Guterres was speaking after Russia´s President Vladimir Putin gave a speech blaming the West for the war.

President Vladimir Putin announced the move on Tuesday in his annual address to the nation.The deal, signed in 2010, limits the number of US and Russian nuclear warheads and gives each the power to inspect the other´s weapons. Mr Biden´s comments came as he met a key group of Nato allies in Poland. The group of eastern European states, known as the Bucharest Nine, reiterated their condemnation of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine nearly a year since its start. Putin´s decision to suspend involvement in the nuclear treaty was officially pushed through by both houses of Russia´s parliament on Wednesday.But Russia´s foreign ministry later said Moscow would continue to comply with the New Start treaty´s restrictions in a ""responsible approach"".A senior military official told Russia´s lower house that the country would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes.What is the New Start treaty?Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.Speaking ahead of the meeting with leaders from the Bucharest Nine nations - which make up Nato´s eastern flank - Mr Biden said suspending New Start was a ""big mistake"" and reiterated the US commitment to the military alliance.""Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made. We will defend literally every inch of Nato,"" he said. Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any member state is treated as an attack on all and requires a joint response.At the meeting he told the assembled leaders that they were the ""front line of our collective defence"". In a joint statement after the meeting the group said they were committed to increasing Nato´s military presence on their territories.Russia says Nato - which could soon see Sweden and Finland become new members - represents an existential threat.Mr Putin, speaking at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of the war, said Russia was fighting in Ukraine for its ""historical"" lands.""I just heard from the top military leadership of the country that a battle is ongoing right now, for our historical lands, for our people,"" he said.Earlier he met China´s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow and said cooperation with Beijing was ""very important to stabilise the international situation"". Mr Wang said Beijing was ready to strengthen its partnership with Moscow and said their relationship would not be affected by pressure from other countries.China´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visitWagner chief blames deaths on lack of ammunitionHow Russia´s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failureRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinNuclear weaponsJoe BidenMore on this storyChina´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit4 days agoWagner chief blames deaths on lack of ammunition4 days agoHow Russia´s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failure5 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Beneath his green helmet, dark shadows ringed his eyes. He had been on his feet all night fighting. Like many on Ukraine´s eastern front, he is both battle-hardened and war-weary.""It´s difficult. People don´t get enough sleep. They are standing for 20 hours. The fight goes on around the clock. I can´t say more, it´s secret. But, we can´t go back.""His unit, from the Ukraine´s 35th Brigade, is part of the defence of Vuhledar. The name means gift of coal, and this prosperous mining town was once home to 15,000 people. But now it´s a wasteland - one of many on Ukraine´s 1,300 kilometre (807 mile) front line.   Blackened apartment blocks tower over deserted streets. A church has been reduced to a shell - its roof peeled off and windows shattered. A cross still stands at the front, punctured by shrapnel. In the playground, there are bullet holes in the slide. Vuhledar´s children are long gone. The town sits on high ground in the heavily contested Donbas region in the east. From here Ukraine can target rail lines used by the Russians for resupply. It needs to hold this bastion. Moscow needs to take it. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent months has been here.""The front line is one kilometre away,"" said the commander, having to repeat himself over the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire, this time outgoing. ""They are pushing, and we lack armour. We are waiting for the Lend-Lease [the US programme that provides military equipment] and we will advance."" That´s a familiar refrain on front lines here as Ukraine awaits Western battle tanks promised by its allies.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, The commander, codenamed Beast, says Ukraine´s forces are waiting for Western weapons before advancingFor now, the defenders of Vuhledar use what they have got.A few troops dart into position, to target the enemy. They lob mortars - and obscenities - then make a quick getaway, to avoid being targeted themselves.We move forward carefully to within 500 metres of the front line. The Russians have no line of sight. We are shielded by buildings. But suddenly there´s a warning shout. We have to take cover at a wall. The troops have heard something overhead, possibly a Russian drone. That´s our cue to pull back.The Russians may have eyes in the sky here - and superior firepower - but critics back home are questioning their vision.A hapless Russian attempt to take the town earlier this month ended in heavy losses and humiliation. A column of tanks and armoured vehicles headed straight for Ukrainian positions - through minefields - in full view on a flat plain. Ukraine stopped them in their tracks, much as it stopped an armoured column approaching Kyiv last year. If the Russians learned anything from that, it didn´t show in Vuhledar.About 300 souls remain in this broken town without heat or light - frozen in place by age, clinging to their memories. Solace comes in the form of Oleh Tkachenko, a jovial evangelical pastor in combat gear, who brings aid here twice a week.  Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Pastor Oleh (right) gives out food and hugs on aid trips to VuhledarHe arrives in the early morning, before the shelling reaches its peak. Soon his armoured van attracts a queue of men and women bundled up in winter coats and hats. ""Hang on,"" he says, as hands reach out for freshly baked bread. ""It´s one loaf for each person.""Valentina, who is 73, quietly waits her turn. She´s a slight figure, bent low over a walking stick, with a head torch around her neck. She tells us she has nowhere else to go.""We are frightened, of course,"" she says. ""But what can we do? We live with it. You can´t say ´Don´t shoot!´ They have their job. We have our lives.""  She recalls life before the invasion. ""The town was quiet, calm, and clean. People worked and had money. What can I say? It was a good town."" Her voice cracks and she falls silent.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Valentina is one of just 300 residents remaining in the embattled townAt the van Pastor Oleh dispenses some advice, and a quick hug before hurrying people away. Crowds are a target.""There´s always shelling,"" he says. ""We try not to gather a lot of people. We park carefully, in the safest places, near the entrance to a building where people can take shelter. We help because it´s a matter of life or death. The risk is huge but so is the reward - saving people´s lives.""  He´s pained by the fate of Vuhledar, which was his home for three years. ""I think it´s completely obvious that Russia hates Ukraine,"" he says. ""It hates our cities and our people, and it is destroying everything it hates. No matter what Russia says, its action scream louder than its words.""The story of Vuhledar is replicated in many parts of the eastern front. Ukraine is resisting, straining every sinew. The Russians are not winning but they aren´t giving up either.There is a cold hard truth on the front lines here. One year after his invasion, President Putin stills holds almost a fifth of this vast country. Both sides have signalled that major offensives are coming. The coming months will be critical.

When the Russian army loomed over Ukraine at the end of February 2022, two university students, Maxsym Lutsyk and Dmytro Kisilenko, decided that they could not sit idle when their country was threatened. Maxsym was 19, Dmytro was 18. I met them at a volunteer centre in central Kyiv on the day they signed up to fight. They took their big step into the unknown dressed to go to a festival, not to war. Dmytro had a yoga mat to sleep on. The older volunteers, saying goodbye to wives and children, could barely raise a smile. Young men, not long out of school, not needing to shave much, were laughing and joking, full of bravado. I suspected they didn´t feel as brave as they wanted to look. Twelve months later, I caught up with Dmytro and Maxsym in the cold winter sun back at the volunteer centre. ""Well, actually there was a lot of fear,"" Dmytro admitted. ""I´m not going to lie because I hadn´t experienced anything like that before. There were a lot of pessimistic news and we were preparing for the worst. And it was mostly like a mixture of bravery… and in our guts we felt that not everything will be all right.""Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym (left) and Dmytro (right) were students when they volunteered as recruits to fight for their countryMaxsym agreed, and many Ukrainians to whom I´ve spoken had the same sort of thoughts. ""A year ago, we had a lot of fear in our hearts and even in our brains. We understood that it will be pretty dangerous to became soldiers, to try to fight with guns. But we also had courage and we had some stupid bravery, and it helped us to overcome our fear.  ""We understood that it will be very bad for us to stay in some shelters, not act in the battle. And it will be bad for us if Russians would occupy Kyiv or other territories of Ukraine. They would kill us or put us in prison because of our political views.""They were not joining a winning army. The Americans and their allies were expecting a rapid Russian victory, followed by an insurgency that they were preparing to support. Their attitudes changed rapidly after Ukraine had shown how well it could fight with old Soviet-era weapons and a sprinkling of modern ones that Nato had supplied. Since then, Nato, led by the United States, has steadily broken its self-imposed limits on what it will supply. Main battle tanks are the latest upgrade. Ukraine wants modern warplanes next.

""The Russians have made their biggest mistake…  Everyone knows their enemy now. And not only it´s national unity, but it´s international unity… And it´s like someone told me two years ago that the United Kingdom, United States, all the European leaders will help us, and it´s the world, Ukraine will be spoken in every television news, I wouldn´t have imagined that."" The conflict forced the North Atlantic alliance to face up to the reality of a sharp and dangerous new division in Europe. The relationship with Moscow that had been under increasing strain for more than a decade snapped when President Putin ordered the invasion last February.With Ukraine, its people and Europe propelled into a new and dangerous era, the continent has come full circle from the hopeful years that followed the end of the Cold War. In 1989, six months before the Berlin Wall was toppled, the first President George Bush laid out the dream of a ""Europe whole and free"". It does not feel like that on the front lines in Donbas. But Kyiv today is a city transformed from the shuttered, apprehensive place it was in the first few weeks after the invasion. Snow swirled around the crowds that packed the platforms at the main railway station. Wind that felt as if it had come off the coldest part of the steppe cut into thousands of women and children, about to become refugees, who were pushing to get onto trains heading west, away from the Russians. Being there felt like watching a re-run of old newsreels from the 20th Century´s darkest times. Barriers were blocking roads, welders were making tank traps from steel girders, and thousands of bottles were being filled with petrol to make Molotov cocktails to throw at the Russian tanks everyone expected. At the moment, the capital has a veneer of normality. Shops are open, people with money can go to restaurants, and there is a rush hour. Of course, it is not normal, because the country is at war, and by mid-evening the streets are quiet. Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym Lutsyk (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko (right) believe Russia has made its biggest mistakeThe contrast between Kyiv and the battered front line towns in the war zones in the east and south is huge. Dmytro and Maxsym fought in the battle that forced a Russian retreat at the end of March. Since then, the pressure has mostly been off the capital, compared to the nightmarish months since the Russian focus turned to the Donbas and the approaches to the Crimean Peninsula in the south.  Maxsym and Dmytro are volunteers, and as students they are allowed to claim an exemption from compulsory military service. Under pressure from his family, Dmytro decided after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv to go back to university. Now he volunteers to help with supplies for Maxsym and his other former comrades. ""It was a really hard decision. But when all your battle buddies, or when all your comrades are going to the east, they continue, they are like away, and you just left this community, you feel a bit odd."" His decision does not seem to have affected their friendship. Maxsym stayed with their unit, and in the months since then has been in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, in the battles in Donbas. He looks noticeably older and is more assertive. I saw him in Bakhmut in the summer, as the Russians were starting to attack it. He had driven out of nearby Severodonetsk to get supplies for his unit. He went back that day, and not long before the town fell to the Russians, Maxsym was wounded.  Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, In May last year, three months after volunteering, Maxsym met the BBC in BakhmutIt was, he said, his worst moment of the war. His position was hit by a strike from Russian heavy artillery, a 203mm Pion. His commander, who received Ukraine´s highest award for valour, was killed. Maxsym was knocked cold and had severe concussion. The Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, had to retreat across a river.  ""The Russians destroyed all the bridges, doing intelligence to find places where we are crossing the river and they shelled these places. So staying there for longer period of time was possible, but many guys died there. And if we stayed for a longer period, many more guys would have died in a few weeks.""Maxsym believes that Russian soldiers arrived in Ukraine a year ago swallowing Kremlin propaganda that they would be welcomed as liberators and protectors of Russian speakers. The last year of fighting, he says, on battlegrounds like Severodonetsk and Bakhmut, has wiped out any Russian illusions about what it would take to beat Ukraine. They understand, he said, that they don´t have friends waiting for them. ""They know that they will enter Bakhmut city only when they will destroy it, when they will kill every Ukrainian soldier who is defending it… They understand that they are fighting for territories and for some political reasons of their government.""Ukrainian soldiers who have served in the east do not have illusions either about an easy victory. The Russians have taken huge casualties. But they are still fighting, have capable electronic warfare and air defence systems and kill and wound many Ukrainians. The Kremlin´s appetite for a war of attrition has not slackened. Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian forces have spent months trying to capture the Ukrainian city of BakhmutDmytro and Maxsym see victory the same way as President Volodymyr Zelensky. Every piece of Ukraine needs to be recaptured. Nato has massively increased its support. But giving Ukraine decisive combat power carries too many risks, in American minds especially. A time may come when Ukraine´s allies push for negotiations.Dmytro was firm. ""Every inch of Ukrainian land which were recognized as Ukrainian in 1991 should be Ukrainian."" President Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine belongs to Russia. Ironically, the war he started is building the Ukrainian nation. ""We have a joke,"" Maxsym said. ""Putin will be made a hero of Ukraine for the job he´s done to unite Ukraine, to build our economy, to build our army, and to make the Ukrainian nation great.""Dmytro laughed. ""But yeah, the war is horrible, but it´s like the price for our unity and our country.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaUkraineMore on this storyStudent-turned-soldier: ´It was like hell´30 May 2022Has Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?3 days agoHow Russia´s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failure5 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Now, Kyiv´s soldiers are in the UK learning how to operate them.Some, like Sasha, are battle hardened. He´s been fighting in eastern Ukraine. But he is swapping his old Russian T-80 tank for the British Army´s Challenger 2. His friend, Grisha, was just driving tractors until a few months ago. Now they´re both learning to drive a 60-tonne tank - much heavier and more sophisticated than anything they´ve been used to. The British Army´s Challenger 2 may be more than 20 years old, but both Sasha and Grisha see it as a vast improvement on Ukraine´s older and lighter Soviet-era tanks. Sasha raves about its suspension and manoeuvrability, and easy access to the engine. The driver is also the mechanic. But he particularly likes the fact that inside there´s a very British piece of kit to heat water for cups of tea. He says his old tank didn´t have such creature comforts. Grisha´s focused on their main purpose. He says Western tanks, like the Challenger 2, are exactly the kind of weapons Ukraine needs to win this war.Image caption, Sasha says these weapons are what Ukraine needsBritain is giving Ukraine just 14 Challenger 2s. But other nations are now following the UK´s lead in providing Ukraine with Western main battle tanks. In all, at least 11 countries have now pledged to do the same, though it´s still not clear how many will be delivered or when they´ll arrive. Some nations have refused to discuss numbers. Soldiers like Sasha and Grisha have been at a British Army base in Dorset for the past few weeks  - driving training vehicles rather than the ones that will eventually be delivered to Ukraine. The Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, were among the VIPs to visit them to assess their progress. Mr Wallace says it´s not just about learning to drive and fire the Challenger, but how to ""weave them together"" with armoured vehicles and artillery to create ""a combined arms effect"". Image caption, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace joins Ukrainian soldiers and their British trainersIn other words, how to use them for offensive operations to take back ground from Russia. Posing for a photograph with grateful Ukrainian soldiers on top of a Challenger, Mr Wallace points to the distance and says ""Crimea that way!"". He jokes that it´s more motivation than ""a two-hour speech"" in what sounds like a jibe at President Putin´s latest address. As well as the 14 UK Challenger tanks, Britain is also providing Ukraine with 20 Bulldog armoured troop carriers and 30 AS-90 self-propelled artillery guns.When we visit, Ukrainian soldiers are already wielding wrenches and tools - showing they´re learning fast to keep them maintained. One of their British trainers, Lance Corporal Zach Reid of the King´s Royal Hussars says the Ukrainians have shown they´re ""very bright, with technical skills which makes it easy to instruct"". He also believes the arrival of the Challenger 2 could be a ""game changer"" with its heavier armour, its night sights and thermal imaging. Few Russian tanks have the same. The British Army has, in theory, 227 Challenger 2 tanks. In reality fewer than half that number are fit for battle. Built in the late 1990s some are likely to have been cannibalized for spare parts no longer manufactured. But Ben Wallace signals that he could still send more. The head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, has admitted that just sending 14 tanks has ""temporarily weakened"" the British Army. Mr Wallace himself is pressing the Treasury for more money. He notes that 20 of 30 Nato members have promised to increase their defence spending since Russia´s invasion. Britain so far has not. But Mr Wallace´s immediate focus is on helping Ukraine win this war, even if it means raiding his own stocks and supplies. As to the question ´could Ukraine be sent more British made tanks?´, he says ""I´d be open to giving more if we think that´s the right thing to do"".Image caption, The soldiers will spend the next few weeks training before returning to UkraineFor Sasha and Grisha the next few weeks will involve more training - including learning how to fire the Challenger 2´s 120mm rifled gun. The tanks they use are being fitted out elsewhere for battle - including replacing communications systems. Getting them to Ukraine will present another logistics challenge. They´re too heavy and big to be flown to Poland by aircraft. But there is a sense of urgency to get them to the front - in time for an expected Ukrainian spring offensive. Britain was the first Western nation to pledge main battle tanks to Ukraine. It wants to be the first to see their tanks join the battle.

The paper says the top appointment has to be approved by MSPs and a source tells the paper ""some won´t vote for Kate"".Image caption, The other two hopefuls are the focus of The Herald´s front page, with ""questions over the credibility"" of Humza Yousaf, after claims the health secretary´s account of missing a key vote on gay marriage was deemed ""not true"" by an SNP cabinet minister. Ash Regan is pictured with a quote saying she will ""hand independence back to the Yes movement"".Image caption, The Scottish Daily Mail also leads with the health secretary, calling him ""Humza the hypocrite"" and claiming Mr Yousaf skipped the final same-sex marriage vote ""due to his religious views"".Image caption, A poll of SNP supporters puts Kate Forbes at the front of the race, reports The National. But the same poll, carried out for The Big Partnership, says a third of those asked were still undecided. The front page promotes an article written by Ms Forbes in which she describes a ""tough first week back"" from maternity leave.Image caption, The second lead in The Daily Telegraph sees Kate Forbes insist that voters are comfortable with her religious beliefs. But the main story is about Ukraine on the first anniversary of its invasion by Russia. It looks at what a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could look like. The paper carries an editorial from the Archbishop of Canterbury who warns that Russia must not be crushed in any deal ""like Germany after 1919"".Image caption, ""Kate´s stalker hell"" is The Scottish Sun´s headline as it reports on a man who sent hundreds of emails to Kate Forbes. Craig Hackett, 23, was given a five-year non-harassment order for causing her ""fear and alarm"".Image caption, The resignation of Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone is the Scottish Daily Express lead story. The paper notes that the outgoing chief recently presented a paper to the Scottish Police Authority warning that the service was becoming ""unsustainable"" due to pressure from other public sector organisations.Image caption, Another main story in the papers is the first anniversary of the Ukraine war. The Scotsman prints a special wrap-around image of a man standing in the rubble of a shelled apartment block. The only colour in the cover comes from the colours of the Ukrainian flag.Image caption, ""Ukraine´s year of blood"" is the headline in The Times. It reports that Rishi Sunak will issue a ""rallying cry"" to get fighter jets to Ukraine. An image of Ukrainian refugee Olha Boyko draped in her nation´s colours and sitting on the rocks of Carmarthenshire also features on the front page. She fled the country while 34 weeks pregnant and was given sanctuary in Wales, the paper says.Image caption, ""Heroes never give in"" says the Metro, with an image of Ukrainian flags honouring the dead at a cemetery in Kharkiv. The paper says Ukraine still stands defiant in the face of Russian aggression.Image caption, The P&J reveals a major incident was called at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Wednesday after a surge in emergency cases. Residents tell the paper they saw more than a dozen ambulances queued up outside with acutely-ill patients inside. Health bosses had to put out a plea for off-duty staff to come in and help.Image caption, The Courier marks the Ukraine anniversary with a feature on Svetlana Pokhova, a Ukrainian who has settled in Perth. The main story claims council budget cuts could end the annual Christmas lights switch-on and freeze plans for a new swimming pool in the city centre. Suggested savings also include ending school breakfast clubs and adult literacy services.Image caption, The new deposit return scheme is the main story in the Glasgow Times. The paper says the scheme, due to start in August, will impact the city´s bin collections. The paper believes purple bin collections will end and that a number of jobs will go as a result.Image caption, The owner of a therapy dog stolen in Dundee says he is desperate to get his pet back safely, reports the Evening Telegraph. Wolfy the Siberian husky was taken on Tuesday evening, sparking a police probe. The eight-year-old dog was taken while working with a vulnerable man outside Greggs on the Murraygate.Image caption, Stolen ebikes in Aberdeen have been tracked down and located inside thieves´ flats thanks to GPS technology in the bikes themselves, reports the Evening Express.Image caption, And for the third day in a row, the Daily Star features the ongoing fruit and vegetable shortage currently facing the UK on its front page. This time, the paper turns its attention to Environment Secretary Therese Coffey who on Thursday suggested turnips could be a suitable alternative while other vegetables remain in short supply.Related Internet LinksHerald ScotlandThe ScotsmanDaily RecordThe Scottish SunThe TimesThe NationalDaily Mail OnlineScottish Daily ExpressDaily StarAberdeen Evening ExpressDundee Evening TelegraphEdinburgh Evening NewsGlasgow Evening TimesThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Here, 10 Ukrainians share the last photo they took on their mobile phones before their country changed forever - and talk about what has happened to them since.Selfies and walksThis was taken on 23 February 2022 and captures my walk around my district. It was good weather that day, but there was a feeling that something might happen.I took the picture because of the nice weather and because I was looking good. It´s in the countryside on the outskirts of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. It´s my favourite place.In the first weeks after Russia´s invasion I stayed at home, but on 7 April, we moved west to Vinnytsia and then to Kyiv.When I look at the picture, it feels like it is from a different life.Angelina Chaban, 24Working from home with my catI was working at home on 22 February, taking calls with my cat next to me, just enjoying life. I took the picture because my cat looked adorable.Her name is Fura, which means truck. My sister rescued her from the side of a highway when she was a kitten.There was some media coverage at the time suggesting something was going to happen, and people were talking about it. But I was hopeful that if there was an escalation, it wouldn´t affect the civilian population. On the 25th we decided to leave Kyiv. We brought the cat with us and moved to north-west Ukraine. In the summer, we returned. Anna, 32Pre-school projectsMy daughter, Marta, made this candle in pre-school and brought it home on 22 February. I remember being happy that the children were being creative and making things, and I was proud of her because it was so pretty and well made.I didn´t know then what would happen next.My daughter will turn seven in March but she hasn´t been to pre-school since 24 February last year. My wife won´t let her.Initially, I was really worried that if there was a war my family and I would have to separate. But we´re still here.Ihor Bezrukyi, 51Dinner and drinks with friendsIt was just an ordinary day and after work I decided to pop into my friend´s bar to have a couple of drinks. Afterwards, they took me out for some beer, local food and vodka made from horseradish root.I don´t remember exactly what I was feeling but I know we were cracking jokes. We did talk about the possibility of a Russian invasion, but then all together we were like: ""Nah"". A couple of days after the invasion, I met two of the guys I was out with that evening. We were all helping the military to build barricades around the centre of Odesa. Looking back, it was a spectacular sight - dozens of hipsters lugging sandbags.When I look at the photo now, I feel nostalgic for the person I used to be.Valeriia Dubrovska, 28A long weekend in LvivA friend had come to visit me in Lviv on her birthday and it was the first long weekend off I´d had in a while.We did a tour of the city and went to see a newly-opened panoramic view from the Church of Sts Olha and Elizabeth. We were the last visitors there that day, so they asked us to close the door as we left.I felt pure happiness in those days. I was happy with my friends and my work. But there was also something in the air, a sense that something inevitable was coming and that everything would change.Nowadays, the viewing point we looked out of is closed. I am still in Lviv, but I rarely take photos with my phone. Now I take camera photos to document what is happening.Sofiia Doroshenko, 30Family days at homeI took this photo of my first child, Yaroslav, on 19 February at our home in Dnipro. He was only six months old at the time. My dog is also in it - she´s a big friend of my son.We left our home on 24 February. I drove for three days to the western part of Ukraine to bring my family to a safer place. Our home in Dnipro is still there but no-one is living in it. I had to ask friends to clean it because when we left the fridge was still full of food.I used to own a travel agency but now tourism is completely dead. Now, I volunteer with the army, bringing cars for the military from the border to the central part of Ukraine. I´m always driving, driving, driving.In this period of a child´s life they grow so quickly. Sometimes I´m away for 10 days and when I come back I find he has learned something new.Ievgen Pereverziev, 40A semi-final matchWe posed for a team photo after losing in the semi-finals of a local football tournament in Kharkiv. I scored the only goal in that game for our team.Even though we lost, we were happy because we had played well. I didn´t believe at the time that a war would happen.I want to play another tournament with my team.Borys Shelahurov, 28A driving lesson and a coffee cupI took this picture of a ""Paris I love you"" coffee cup on 22 February 2022 after a driving lesson. It was part of a photo project I´ve been working on. We were living in Bucha and spent the first two weeks after the invasion in the basement of a pre-school that was close to our building. I lost 10kg in those two weeks.We escaped Russian occupation by foot on 10 March, walking 22km (14 miles). When we reached the first Ukrainian checkpoint, I nearly cried.I´m still trying to do my photo project despite the war. I still haven´t passed my driving test.Oleksandr Popenko, 29Fooling around with friendsI work at the Lviv National Art Gallery, the Potocki Palace. Every year, the museum puts up these cheesy winter decorations until the spring and I always make fun of them.Everyone in the city was talking about the possibility of war. A couple of days before the 24th, not knowing what might happen of course, I asked my friend to take a picture of me with the decorations - to take the edge off.I´m still working at the museum but everything is different now. It feels like 100 years have passed, we have lived through so much.Andrii Rybka, 43Children´s games at the galleryThis picture was taken at the presentation of a new book in the National Art Museum in Kyiv. While the adults were talking, my children and my friend´s children sat down to play a game.On 6 March, I drove with my children to the Hungarian border, left the car there and continued on foot.I think about how carefree the children are in this photo and how, so soon afterwards, they were forced to make such a disturbing journey - driving for a long time without knowing where they were going, as their mothers cried.Zhenya Molyar, 41Stories edited for length and clarity.

But I will never accept it.""´Half and half´Tanya grew up in Moscow but has lived in London since 2020 when she moved to do a Masters and decided to make the UK home.  Her mum hasn´t been able to leave Russia because of visa issues and hasn´t seen Tanya´s dad since before the war started.Tanya says she´s tried to carry on with normal and went ahead with her wedding last summer.

One such family was Celia and Steve Quartermain from Leyton, east London. They took in Anastasiia Medolyz, her husband and their six-year-old son.Unlike most refugees, Ms Medolyz, 32, was lucky to already know her host family well as she had stayed with them during an exchange programme in 2005.After touring London and Yorkshire as a teenager with her school choir, her thoughts often turned to when she would return to the UK, but looking back now, she says she ""couldn´t have imagined I´d ever be here for this reason"".Image caption, Anastasiia Medolyz and her family now have their own flat in LeytonMs Medolyz had only just begun a new media job in Kyiv when her husband urged the family to flee the city and head west.""We had heard that the Russian army was at the border but I didn´t want to believe it,"" she says.""At five in the morning we woke up to loud explosions, my husband looked out the window and saw a rocket destroy an area near the home of one of my friends. In 10 minutes we woke up our child, got in our car, and drove west for seven hours.""She adds they ""tried to pick up my grandmother on the way but her town was already under Russian control and cut off from electricity, water, gas or anything"".  Having escaped Ukraine, it took the family three weeks to find a volunteer who could reunite her grandmother with Ms Medolyz´s mother safely back in Kyiv.""This volunteer is now in Russian captivity,"" she says. ""I only found out when I tried to message him and a Russian soldier wrote back from his phone."" Image caption, Celia Quartermain told her friend they would take in her family if they could make it to the UKMs Quartermain was communicating with Ms Medolyz when she first heard about the invasion. The Leyton resident explained that Ms Medolyz was sending them updates as they bundled into a car and made their way west to Lviv, worried about getting captured.The pair decided to stay in touch ""and I said to her at the time that if she could get out, we´d help her"", Ms Quartermain says.´We´re safe here but always thinking of home´ Ukrainian friends achieve candle-making dream Ukrainian LGBT refugees plan to wed in UKThe family eventually arrived in east London in July last year and spent six months with the Quartermains before moving into a flat of their own nearby.Ms Medolyz now works for an education agency while her son has settled in well at the local primary school. She believes her family has a good life.Yet despite this, she still longs for her home country.Image caption, Ms Medolyz´s son has settled in well at the local primary school""When the war ends and Ukraine wins, I want to go home and support my country and live and work in my native city, but I will always remember everything this country has done for Ukrainians,"" she says.""On one hand you need to support yourself and your family and do everything you can to survive.

He will make his address in the Polish capital, Warsaw - a day after his surprise visit to Ukraine. His speech comes hours after Russia´s Vladimir Putin announced Moscow was suspending participation in a key arms control treaty with the US.He made the announcement in his state of the nation address.The leaders´ competing speeches come days before the first anniversary of Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Warsaw, the US president is expected to stress the vital role the United States has played in galvanising Western backing for Ukraine against Russian aggression. But he will also be looking to shore up support for his policy at home, where some politicians are expressing doubts about the scale of US involvement.In his speech a stone´s throw from the Kremlin, President Putin again blamed the West for Russia´s invasion, complaining of Western hypocrisy and of withdrawing from ""fundamental agreements"".""I want to repeat: it is they who are culpable for the war, and we are using force to stop it,"" he said to great applause.Mr Putin also reiterated his unfounded claim that Moscow had been facing a neo-Nazi threat from Ukraine, which he used as justification to launch his ""special military operation"". He said Russia would suspend its participation in the New Start treaty - the last remaining nuclear arms deal between Russia and the US - adding: ""No-one should be under the illusion that global strategic parity can be violated.""Putin promotes Russian escalation in annual speechPresident Putin´s speech fact-checkedAhead of his address, US President Joe Biden will meet Poland´s leader, Andrzej Duda, and other central European allies to discuss bilateral cooperation and to strengthen Nato against aggression. That´s after the president met his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on Monday - telling a press conference that the US will back Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"". ""We have every confidence you´re going to continue to prevail,"" he said.The pair also visited a memorial to soldiers who have died in the nine years since Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces captured parts of the eastern Donbas region.After the visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new package of security assistance for Ukraine valued at $450m (£373m), as well as an extra $10m in emergency assistance to maintain Ukraine´s energy infrastructure.A new wave of sanctions against individuals and companies ""that are trying to evade or backfill Russia´s war machine"" will also be announced later this week.The US is one of Ukraine´s biggest allies and has already given billions of dollars in military assistance. Mr Biden recently announced that the US would send 31 battle tanks and longer-range missiles but has stopped short so far of sending F-16 fighter jets, despite repeated calls for them from Ukraine.However, Mr Zelensky on Monday said that he had discussed with Joe Biden the possibility of the US sending other weapons.

Images of his meetings are famous, with the Russian leader at one end and the person he is speaking to so far away that you wonder if it is hard for them to hear one another.It was not like that when he met China´s top foreign policy official, Wang Yi.There they were, sitting within handshake distance, with an oval-shaped table in the middle.It could be that the proximity was achieved by seating placement at a previously used table, with the Chinese delegation directly across the middle rather than at the long ends but the effect was the same. When the footage was released, it appeared to be a deliberately symbolic move to show that he felt safe enough to be that close to the representative of such an important friend.Of course, it has not always been that way. Decades ago, Beijing´s network of underground fallout shelters was designed to protect the citizens of the Chinese capital from a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.Yet now Xi Jinping´s administration sees Russia as a front-line enemy of US influence. A nation which - like North Korea - may be considered an international pariah but which serves a useful geopolitical purpose.The Chinese government did not even seem that embarrassed when President Putin returned home from attending Beijing Winter Olympics, having proclaimed a new ""no limits"" relationship with China and, within weeks, launched the invasion of Ukraine.Many have asked whether Mr Xi was warned about the imminent war when he sat next to his Russian counterpart who must have been considering barely anything else at the time.China is walking along a very delicate path in its dealings with Russia over Ukraine. Mr Xi may feel like he is confidently striding down the track, but some think that the path is crumbling at the edges, with Beijing´s claim to neutrality increasingly difficult to stand up.Wang Yi comes out of meetings proclaiming that China and Russia are together promoting ""peace and stability"".In other parts of the world, it will seem ludicrous to use expressions like ""peace and stability"" on a trip to Russia just before the first anniversary of that country´s invasion of Ukraine.Beijing knows this and yet decided to press ahead nevertheless, in the full knowledge that it will take a hit reputationally because it has calculated that it is more important to offer significant moral support to Vladimir Putin at this time.When Wang Yi met Sergei Lavrov he said, ""I am ready to exchange views with you my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest and I look forward to reaching new agreements.""Russia´s foreign minister said the two were showing solidarity and defending each other´s interests despite ""high turbulence on the world stage"", as if this turbulence was something floating in the ether rather than chaos of his own government´s making.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Putin and Biden´s speeches compared in under a minuteEarlier this week in Beijing, China´s Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that the conflict in Ukraine could spiral out of control if certain countries kept pouring fuel on the fire.He was referring to the US, a country which is openly giving military assistance to the Ukrainian army but which has warned China not to provide Russia with weapons and ammunition.Analysts are now asking what options China might consider if it looks like President Putin is facing a humiliating battlefield defeat.Researchers in America say that Beijing is already supplying Russia with dual-use equipment, technology which can appear to be civilian but which can also, for example, be used to repair fighter jets.It has also not tried to hide the fact that it is buying up Russian oil and gas to make up for markets its neighbour lost because of sanctions which followed the invasion.What support is China giving Russia? Why so many Russians turn a blind eye to warAnd Vladimir Putin confirmed in his meeting with Wang Yi that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would soon travel to Moscow. It is thought this might happen in the coming months.In a way, the Kremlin is doing China´s dirty work. It is draining Western military resources and putting pressure on Nato and if Russia´s economy tanks because of it, does that really matter to Beijing? It will just need more Chinese products for the recovery afterwards.The problem is that Western countries have been quite united, Russia does not appear able to win and, increasingly, China is being seen standing side by side with a bully who forced a bloody, prolonged war on Europe.China has to be careful not to bite off more than it can handle, but the rest of the world also will not want Asia´s giant dragged into this war to a greater extent than it already is.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingChinaRussiaVladimir PutinMore on this storyWhat support is China giving Russia?6 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they´re considering providing lethal support,"" he said. He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China´s potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.The US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. Mr Blinken told CBS that ""of course, in China, there´s really no distinction between private companies and the state"".What support is China offering Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a ""serious problem for us and in our relationship"", he added.Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.It would be the most ""catastrophic"" thing that could happen to the relationship between the two giants, said top Republican senator Lindsay Graham.""It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie,"" he told ABC News. ""Don´t do this.""Mr Blinken´s warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia´s economy. China´s trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.""We´ve been very clear that we shouldn´t fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,"" he said. He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia ""in the months ahead"". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.The top US diplomat´s remarks come ahead of a scheduled visit by Mr Wang to Moscow, as part of the Chinese foreign policy chief´s tour of Europe.Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had ""neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire"" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chinese foreign affairs Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech in Munich on SaturdayChina would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.""I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,"" Mr Wang said.He added that there were ""some forces that seemingly don´t want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon"", but did not say who he meant. The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a ""peace speech"" on the anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy´s foreign minister Antonio Tajani.Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi´s speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening row over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the US. Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China´s ""surveillance balloon program"" across five continents.Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China has denied sending a spy balloon.And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would ""bear all the consequences"" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would ""follow through to the end"" in the event ""the US insists on taking advantage of the issue"", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.The full interview with CBS - the BBC´s US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaRussiaMore on this storyRussia must be defeated but not crushed - Macron19 FebruaryRussia has committed crimes against humanity - US19 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished6 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Now, he wants to travel there again.""I am going back to Ukraine because I need to finish my final year, sit my exams and collect my certificate,"" said the 28-year-old.  ""There are no options for me in Nigeria,"" he added.Ukraine was home to more than 80,000 foreign students in 2020, nearly a quarter were from Africa.Some are considering returning to Ukraine as they struggle to find somewhere to finish their studies. For Mr Olawale, the choice was easy. In July 2022, the Nigerian Medical and Dental Council (MCDN) said it would no longer accept degrees from Ukrainian universities awarded online. It was a move that Ghana´s medical council copied two months later.""I needed to finish my degree in person,"" Mr Olawale said. He was fortunate that the place where he was studying was a long way from the frontline.Mr Olawale is in his final year at the National University in Uzhgorod, which has been largely shielded from the destruction of the war as it is in western Ukraine near the border with Slovakia.""My city is safe and it´s the best option for me,"" Mr Olawale told the BBC.Others have not been as lucky.

She initially fled to Hungary and then moved to the Netherlands where she now lives with a host family. Her temporary visa expires in a month unless she gets a skilled job.Having graduated in 2022, she is now a qualified doctor, but says job hunting without Dutch language skills has been a challenge.""My only options are to stay here or go back to Ukraine.""Some people say: ´Why don´t you just go back to Nigeria?´ But they don´t understand, that´s easier said than done,"" Dr Orakpo said, citing the country´s worsening economic and healthcare systems.""I have a goal in life, I want to practise medicine,"" she said, adding that the security situation in Nigeria makes that a challenge.Getting a visa to return to Europe would be near impossible if she returned to Nigeria as having lived outside the country since 2016 she has no permanent address or bank account, she said. Image source, Fehintola “Moses” DamilolaImage caption, Some of Fehintola ""Moses"" Damilola´s fellow students have gone back to Sumy to take their final examsLike many Nigerian medical students, Fehintola ""Moses"" Damilola, who had been studying in Sumy near the Russian border, struggled to continue his classes online, especially after the authorities said an online degree would not be recognised. ""We´ve all been scrambling since then,"" Mr Damilola said.""I don´t want to go back to Ukraine right now,"" he explained. ""The experience of being stuck in Sumy as the bombardment began and the difficulty in getting out was very traumatic,"" he added.Nevertheless, Mr Damilola knows of Indian students who have returned as final exams are approaching.Last year´s exams were waived because of the war. But this year, the Ukrainian exam authority has said that the exam will be held in person in Kyiv on 14 March.Attending means signing a wavier to ""accept all safety risks"", read the email to students.An alternative option is available for those ""who do not want to return to Ukraine"" in the form of ""140 computer testing centres all around the world"", although timelines for that are still unclear.""Realistically, we don´t have many options,"" Mr Damilola said. ""The test centres in other countries do not seem feasible right now, so a lot of us are thinking about going back.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Moses ""Damilola"" Fehintola spoke in 2022 about how his dream had been cut shortThe UN´s refugee agency, UNHCR, says almost eight million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring European countries.The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reported 625,000 non-Ukrainian nationals were among them, but warned that some people may have been counted twice.Waves of students have spent months migrating around the continent looking for a safe country to complete their degrees. Many have become entangled in complex bureaucracy. Enrolling into another university often means a tough visa process, language requirements and high tuition fees as many scholarships are reserved for Ukrainian nationals. ""European governments have welcomed Ukrainians with open arms,"" said Nine Fumi Yamamoto of BIPoC Ukraine, a Berlin-based organization helping people of colour fleeing the war.""But third-country nationals fleeing the same war haven´t been so lucky,"" she said.The European Union offered unprecedented rights and freedoms to Ukrainians when it activated its Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for the first time in history. The law offers those eligible a residence permit and access to education and the labour market. ´Nowhere to go´The EU says this includes third-country nationals who ""are unable to return in safe and durable conditions to their country"".It says TPD visas have been issued to four million people fleeing the war, 200,000 of which are for non-Ukrainian nationals. But many charities and grassroots organisations say the situation on the ground is different. ""We´ve seen people who have been living in Ukraine for 10 years be rejected.

Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine´s neutral status.President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine´s elected president. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century.In Kherson: Joy, tears and talk of justiceHow Putin changed his war aimsA month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine´s two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia´s leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vladimir Putin celebrated annexing Ukrainian territory: ""Together forever"" is written at the top of the screenTo bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia´s first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.Russia must be defeated but not crushed - MacronPresident Putin warned in December that the war ""could be a lengthy process"", but then added later that Russia´s goal was ""not to spin the flywheel of military conflict"", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its ""historical frontiers"" and ""rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya"", spelling out that Ukraine´s southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.What gains has Russia made?The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia´s border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a ""significant result for Russia"". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, ""has become Russia´s internal sea"", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. Tracking the war in mapsIs Russia losing the war?Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia´s bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:The retreat of 30,000 Russian troops across the Dnipro river from Kherson in November was a strategic failureA 56km (35-mile) armoured convoy that ground to a halt near Kyiv at the start of the war was a logistical failureThe deaths of a large number of recently mobilised troops in a Ukrainian new-year missile attack on Makiivka were an intelligence failureThe sinking of the flagship Black Sea battle cruiser the Moskva was a defensive failure, as was the spectacular attack in October 2022 that shut the Kerch Strait bridge for weeks.Russia´s warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support ""for as long as it takes"" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. ""We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,"" he warned.Image source, BBC/Goktay KoraltanImage caption, Ukrainian troops are doggedly holding on to Bakhmut amid fierce Russian attacksKyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.Can we say how many Russians have died?Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.BBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.UK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.Ukraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.The UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.Has Putin been damaged?President Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.At home, Russia´s economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.Any attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.Dissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia´s leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.Ukraine´s shift to the WestThe seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine´s pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.Four months into Russia´s 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.Russia´s long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato´s orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.Not only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state:  ""It´s a truth and it must be recognised.""How will the war end?No end is currently in sight. Ukraine´s position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine´s internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.By annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.There is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.Was Nato to blame for the war?Nato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia´s invasion.But it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato´s expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. Blaming Nato´s expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From May: Sweden and Finland formally submit Nato applicationsWhat are your questions about the war in Ukraine?

It is bordered by the Moskva river and the Kremlin on one side, and on the other by imposing Stalinist apartment buildings and 21st Century skyscrapers on the noisy Sadovoye ring road. A maze of narrow streets echo the past, dotted with churches and aristocratic mansions from the 19th Century. Bolshaya Ordinka street takes its name from Tatar-Mongol rule, hundreds of years before, when emissaries would come to collect tributes from Moscow´s princely leaders.I was there last February when I was phoned by a friend, born in Ukraine´s second-biggest city Kharkiv, who now worked in Moscow.""Was Putin really going to start a war with Ukraine?"" he asked. Neither of us wanted to believe it.But surrounded by reminders of Russia´s often relentlessly violent past I felt war was now inevitable. My daily walks were my way of saying goodbye to a world, and perhaps even a country, that could never be the same again.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russians have left their country in droves - many when Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation last SeptemberHundreds of thousands of Russians have left Russia, including me and my BBC Russian colleagues. But for the majority who have stayed in Russia, life outwardly is pretty much the same as it always was. Especially in the big cities.In Zamoskvorechiye, most of the shops, cafes, the businesses and the banks are still open. Many of the hipster journalists and IT specialists may have left but others have replaced them.Shoppers complain about rising prices, but local alternatives have replaced some imported goods. Image caption, You can still meet for coffee and the logo looks similar, but the Starbucks chain is long goneBookshops still have a wide variety of titles, although books deemed inappropriate are sold in plastic covers.The popular car-sharing service still works, but the cars are now largely Chinese-made.International sanctions have not brought Russia to the brink of 1990s-style economic collapse. But, as Belfast-based Russian academic Aleksandr Titov has observed, Russia is nonetheless living through a crisis. It is a slow-burning crisis, but look closely and there are signs of it everywhere.In Belgorod, close to the Ukrainian border and just 80km (50 miles) from the now war-torn city of Kharkiv, local people are now used to convoys of military trucks roaring towards the front line. If they are troubled by Russia bombing a city where many have friends and relatives, then they´re trying not to show it.Image source, SERGEY BOBOK/AFPImage caption, Most Russians either do not know or do not want to know what their military has done to Ukraine´s second biggest city KharkivCheery street festivals organised by the local governor are well attended, a friend tells me.But local doctors are leaving their jobs in droves, unable to cope with the numbers of war-wounded being brought for treatment in local hospitals.The shelled Russian border town backing Putin´s warResidents feel abandoned and angry in the little frontier town of Shebekino, where cross-border shelling has become a daily reality. One local family visiting St Petersburg were shocked to find nothing had changed while their own lives had been turned upside down. In Pskov, near the Estonian and Latvian borders, the atmosphere is gloomy and everyone pretends the war has nothing to do with them, I am told.Pskov is home to the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, now notorious for the war crimes its troops are accused of carrying out in Bucha, outside Kyiv.A bus service has started up connecting the city to the local cemetery where growing numbers of soldiers killed in Ukraine are being buried. Under a bridge someone has daubed PEACE in big red letters. Image caption, When the BBC visited this cemetery near Pskov there were dozens of fresh graves for Russian paratroopersOn a train heading for Petrozavodsk, near the Finnish border, a friend meets a group of teenagers playing a ""Name that city"" game.  Someone mentions Donetsk: Is it in Russia or Ukraine? None of them are sure. It has been occupied and annexed illegally by their government.How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedWhat do they think about the war? It´s nothing to do with them. Petrozavodsk appears to have returned to its grim past. Empty shelves, no foreign brands, unaffordably high prices.Do Russians really support the brutality being carried out in Ukraine in their name, or are they pretending it´s not happening to survive? From fleeting impressions and conversations it is hard to draw firm conclusions. Sociologists and pollsters have tried to gauge opinion, but there is no freedom of speech or information in Russia so it is impossible to tell if people are being honest.Polls suggest the majority of Russians, if not supporting the war, certainly do not oppose it. This has prompted angry debates among Russians abroad. Many who study and report on Russia, me included, believe a small percentage of people actively support the war, and a small percentage actively oppose it. Most ordinary Russians are in the middle, trying to make sense of a situation they didn´t choose, don´t understand and feel powerless to change. Could they have stopped it? Probably yes, if more people had stood up for their freedom and challenged state TV propaganda about trumped up threats from the West and Ukraine. Many Russians chose to stay away from politics and let the Kremlin decide for them. But keeping your head down means making very troubling moral compromises.To keep the war from their door, Russians have to pretend this isn´t an expansionist invasion, and must close their eyes to the Ukrainians who are killed and wounded in their tens of thousands and driven from their homes in their millions by what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"".  Image source, MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/Sputnik/AFP Image caption, Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a Putin ally, has blessed Russia´s war effortRussians must accept it´s normal for soldiers to go into schools and tell their children war is a good thing.That it´s normal for priests to support the war and stop praying for peace.That it doesn´t matter they can no longer travel or be part of a broader world.That the Kremlin was right to block the majority of independent media sites they used to read.That a sledgehammer is now a positive symbol of Russian power in executions captured on camera and posted by MPs on Twitter.And that it´s normal to go to jail for years for saying what you think about the war, whether you´re a councillor or a journalist.Why Russians do not protest is perhaps better explained by Russian history and not opinion polls.  Ever since he came to power, President Vladimir Putin has made it no secret that he wants to rebuild Russia and restore its position for the world to respect and reckon with.In speeches and essays he has made clear his belief that Russia occupies a unique place in the world as part of both the East and West. Russia has its own traditions, religion, and its own ways of doing things. Russians need order and control, and demand respect.Image source, YURI KADOBNOV/AFPImage caption, Vladimir Putin always blames the West for the war and state TV repeats his world viewThis message has echoed down the centuries and brooks no dissent or prospect for change. It´s a chokehold - to use a judo term from his favourite sport.This Putin vision comes with a price: Russians have paid with their freedom; Ukrainians are paying with their lives.Russia has opened up at times after moments of calamity and catastrophe. After defeat in Afghanistan in 1989 came the Gorbachev era. Defeat against Japan in 1905 was followed by constitutional reform, and after defeat in the Crimean war in 1856 came emancipation of the serfs.One pattern identified by pollsters is that most Russians say they would support peace talks to end the fighting. But what kind of guarantees they would give independent Ukraine is not yet clear.

The two Conservative prime ministers spoke in Parliament on the same day US President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.Mr Biden said the US would back Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"", as the prospect of a Russian spring offensive looms.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warLiz TrussUkraineMore on this storyChina might give Russia weapons and ammo, US warns7 days agoRussia must be defeated but not crushed - Macron19 FebruaryOver 30,000 Wagner fighters injured or killed - US18 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

schemes for refugees since the war broke out exactly a year ago.The figures were released by Stormont´s Executive Office on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.It also confirmed to BBC News NI that more than 7,000 Northern Ireland properties have been offered for use under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.But only 9% of those properties are currently being used to house refugees.How many hosts and guests?Image source, Getty Images/Halfpoint ImagesImage caption, Ukrainian refugees need to secure a sponsor before they are granted visasUkrainians seeking refuge from the war can move to Northern Ireland under two separate refugee programmes that were introduced by the UK government last March.Under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme, refugees can stay in the home of a Northern Ireland sponsor for at least six months, or longer by mutual agreement.There is also the Ukraine Family Scheme where refugees can apply to live with a family member who was already based in the UK.To date: 1,855 Ukrainians have arrived in Northern Ireland under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme276 Ukrainians have sought refuge under the Ukraine Family SchemeThat means in total, 2,131 Ukrainian nationals arrived in Northern Ireland through government refugee schemes after the war broke out on 24 February 2022.Since the Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched, thousands of Northern Ireland households have offered spare rooms or stand alone accommodation for refugees.The Executive Office has confirmed:7,847 hosts signed up to offer accommodation for Ukrainian refugees7,199 properties were offered under the scheme (as some hosts offered more than one home)671 properties are currently being used to house Ukrainian nationals  The Executive Office did not comment on why so few of the homes that were offered over the past year are currently hosting Ukrainians.However, as hosts were initially required to make their accommodation available for six months, it could be that many sponsors simply left the scheme at the end of that period.In other cases, it could be that refugees decided to move out or that the properties did not pass inspection as suitable accommodation.Where are refugees staying?In terms of geographical spread, sponsors in the Belfast City Council area have welcomed the highest percentage (15.7%) of Ukrainian refugees.They were followed closely by hosts in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area who make up 14.5% of sponsorships.The lowest uptake has been in the Fermanagh and Omagh Council area, which accounts for 5.7% of all Ukrainian sponsorship arrangements.How many new patients?Image source, Getty Images/Natalia GdovskaiaImage caption, Ukrainians have free access to NHS services like GP surgeries during their three-year stayUkrainians who are successful in their visa applications have to right to stay in the UK for a period of three years.During that time, they have the right to work and access public services like healthcare and education.According to the latest available figures from Stormont´s Department of Health, 2,308 patients ""with an origin stated as Ukraine"" were registered with a GP in Northern Ireland by 31 January 2023.However, a departmental spokesman advised that figure also includes a small number of Ukrainian patients who were living in Northern Ireland before the war started.Many of the newly-arrived patients will face language barriers when using health services.To assist, there are 14 Ukrainian interpreters currently registered with the department´s Business Services Organisation for work within the health and social care sector.How many new classmates?Image source, Getty Images/Mariia Symchych-Navrotska / EyeEmImage caption, Extra resources are to be allocated to schools to support Ukrainian pupilsThe priority of many refugees was to get their children to safety from bombing which has cost thousands of lives and destroyed much of Ukraine´s civilian infrastructure.By the start of this week, a total of 269 children from Ukraine had enrolled in schools in Northern Ireland, according to the Education Authority (EA).The EA figures relate to school-aged children only and does not include babies and toddlers who may soon need a place in a local classroom.It pointed to previous Stormont data that showed 585 Ukrainians aged from birth to 18 had arrived in Northern Ireland by December 2022.In terms of extra resources, the EA said: ""The Department of Education has received funding to be directed toward additional educational support for children arriving under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and is in discussion with the EA on its allocation.""As part of this exercise, schools and early years providers will be canvassed to arrive at a definitive number of children enrolled across all provision and allocate funding accordingly.""Thanks a millionImage source, Getty Images/Mario GutiérrezImage caption, A monthly cash sum was offered to UK hosts from last March to help meet some of their costsThe UK government has previously said it is ""enormously grateful to all those who have volunteered to share their home with Ukrainian people fleeing war"".Most Homes for Ukraine sponsors are eligible to receive a ""thank you"" payment of £350 per month from the government when they agree to host Ukrainian refugees.This money is often needed to cover hosts´ additional costs, such as higher electricity or heating bills.To date, more than £1m has been paid out to Northern Ireland hosts.The Executive Office confirmed that up to and including 23rd February 2023, the total amount now stands at £1,184,750.Moving out and moving onImage source, Getty Images/Westend61Image caption, In 130 cases, Ukrainian families applied to be matched with a different hostAlthough hosts were asked to commit to a six-month sponsorship initially, some arrangements ended prematurely.However, this does not always mean the relationship between host and guest has ""broken down,"" according to the Executive Office.It explained splits can happen for a variety of reasons ""for example, moving to be closer to work or school, hosts´ circumstances changing, etc"".In those circumstances, refugees can choose to enter the private rented sector or ask to be re-matched to an alternative host by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.""To date 96 rematches have been completed with 34 requests ongoing,"" the Executive Office said.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkrainian refugeesMore on this storyWATCH: Defiant in defence - Ukraine´s year at war3 days agoTop

She said she got a letter from the Welsh government on 6 February saying they must independently find accommodation and leave their hotel by 17 March.

""There is so much unknown, like will we continue with our English classes,"" she said. ""If my daughter will go to school, if my mother will be able to get medical support if she became ill.""Olena is one of 3,000 Ukrainians to have received help from the Welsh government since the start of the war. Many first went to welcome centres, often repurposed hotel buildings like the one where Olena´s family currently live. She said she applied for social housing in September, but her application had not been processed and other options had been ""rejected"". She said they have no information from Swansea council about where they will be moving or if it will be to another town or city.

His invasion of Ukraine has brought conventional warfare back to this continent on a scale not seen since World War Two.His actions have shattered the sense of peace and relative security most of us were used to. For the first time since the Cold War, the possibility of a nuclear attack is being discussed as a real possibility - however remote.But Europe - in and outside the EU - is a sum of many and diverse parts.Russia´s invasion has been a clear reminder to Europeans - even France´s President Macron, the normally outspoken advocate of Europe´s ""strategic autonomy"" - that, in terms of defence - the continent can´t go it alone. The money, the military and weaponry, the united resolve isn´t there compared to the US (and even there, some tiny political fractures are beginning to show).That said, the Kremlin underestimated Europeans a year ago.It bet on them being weak and wholly divided, with each country looking out only for its short-term benefits (like stable energy prices). And the United States being distracted by China. Vladimir Putin underestimated leaders´ resolve to stand by Ukraine and their version of European stability.Russia´s invasion of Ukraine changed Europe.Countries have come together - some slower, or more reluctantly than others - but still:  with unprecedented sanctions against Russia. Western allies´ initial red lines have been repeatedly broken as they´ve clubbed together to send increasingly powerful weaponry to help Ukraine.As the war now approaches its second year, that unity - however imperfect - still holds. Though flickers of public dissent are appearing, for a number of reasons.GermanyImage caption, Germany has welcomed around a million refugees from UkraineTake European big power Germany.The Markus church in Berlin´s Steglitz neighbourhood was packed when I visited recently.Refugees sat side-by-side with German locals as the hauntingly beautiful voices of a Ukrainian mother and daughter singing traditional songs floated out into the freezing night.Though Europe´s biggest economy has conspicuously failed to play a leading role in the Ukraine crisis, Germans call the war their ""watershed moment"". They opened their arms to around a million refugees and transformed post-war defence policies to help Kyiv.Along with other European allies, Germany´s leaders agreed to send heavy weapons, missile launchers and most recently its prestigious Leopard 2 tanks to help Ukraine fight off Russia´s invading forces.But the sentiment of solidarity is slipping a bit. And not only in Germany.In stark contrast to the proclamations of Europe´s political leaders, 48% of the public want a quick end to hostilities, even if that means Ukraine having to hand over some of its territory to Russia. That was the finding of an end-of-2022 survey published by research group Euroskopia, based on questions put to a total of 9,000 people in nine EU countries.This doesn´t mean almost one in every two Europeans is preparing to turn their back on Ukraine. As the BBC´s Europe editor, I travel regularly around the continent. Wherever I go, people tell me they want the suffering there to stop.But as the war grinds bloodily on, views differ sharply over how much they want their country to still be involved, at what cost to them, their family or their businesses (think about spiralling energy costs) or the risk some analysts talk about of the war ""escalating"" beyond Ukraine, perhaps even involving nuclear attacks, and also to what extent they think Russia should be pushed back or punished.War-weariness is certainly something that Ukrainians are increasingly having to contend with - whether they are refugees looking for lodgings or politicians in Kyiv trying to drum up more military support.""One month, two months, three months… I was with a German family for eight months!"" Nina from Kharkiv told me, as I sat with her, towards the back of the Berlin church.""They were like real family. Wonderful. And they didn´t actually ask me to leave. But I knew it was not good. Guests are great but not for so long. We don´t know when this war will end."" Donations for refugees have plummeted an eye-watering 95% since the start of the conflict, according to church chaplain Sven Grebenstein.More than fatigue with the Ukraine war, he thinks Germans have been distracted by the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, linked to the conflict.""[Germans] were falling over themselves to help 12 months ago. They were generous with their time and their money. But then they saw their bills - gas, electricity and food - shoot up. They started being more careful with money they might need for themselves.""ItalyImage caption, In Italy, as elsewhere, industries that use a lot of power are reeling from increased costsItaly, like Germany, used to be hugely reliant on Russian gas, before the EU slapped sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. The energy crisis hit hard.Half of Italians don´t want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, according to opinion polls. Only 26% say they support more sanctions against Russia, if they´d make life more expensive. The same study suggests the percentage in France is 27%.This is a world away from the strongly pro-Nato, pro-military aid stance taken by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni or President Macron. You can´t help wondering if that gap between leaders and so many voters is sustainable.Suspicion of the US and Nato and an openness to the Russian narrative is something you often come across in Italy. Murano, near Venice, is famous for the eye-catching, centuries-old artisanal skill of glass blowing.To create stunning, mouth-moulded vases, stools, bowls and even chandeliers, the glass needs to be molten. Furnaces are kept at a constant temperature of 1200-1400C. The industry has been decimated by spiralling energy bills. But when I visited the Wave Murano Glass factory, I found many workers unwilling to blame Moscow. Young Gabriele told me he didn´t want to compare his family´s suffering to that of civilians in Ukraine but, he insisted, the war had claimed victims all over the place. The cost-of-living crisis is very real for him and his elderly parents living on a basic state pension. He wasn´t an expert on politics, on who´s right and who´s wrong but, he said, the war needed to stop.Factory founder Roberto Beltrami told me Italian attitudes were also affected by the fact that so many businesses had traditionally strong links to Russia.Moscow is well aware of this. Italy and Germany are big targets of Russian disinformation campaigns.Baltic statesImage caption, Nato has boosted its presence in Estonia, which shares a border with RussiaTravel 2,000km to the north-east and, in the Baltic states, you find a completely different European picture.Losing business and investment here is in no way viewed as an obstacle to a tough line against Moscow and public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of strong support of Ukraine. Tiny Estonia spends more than 1% of its GDP on military aid to Kyiv.  The Baltics are viewed as some of Europe´s most ""hawkish"", or hardline nations when it comes to dealing with Russia. Poland and the UK have a similar profile, with the Netherlands not far off.Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur told me Russia´s invasion on 24 February 2022 resonated here in particular, as it coincided with Estonia´s independence day.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were occupied for almost 50 years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Geographical neighbours of Russia, they´ve lived in permanent fear of being invaded again.Members of the EU and Nato, they´re relieved other Western countries now see Russia as a strategic threat to all of Europe, rather than dismissing as a ""regional issue"" the Kremlin´s designs on Ukraine and potentially reasserting its influence over other neighbours.Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, who chaired the weekend´s annual Munich Security Conference, used to be a key adviser to German ex-chancellor Angela Merkel. She´s now blamed by many for having harnessed her country far too closely to Russia. When I asked him if he now felt he had been short-sighted, he insisted Germany´s relationship with Russia was hugely complex. You need only remember the 20 million people slaughtered by the Nazis on lands then belonging to the former Soviet Union. But he conceded that the perspective of Western European leaders on Russia had now definitely changed.""They recognise this is an attack on Europe. This is an overall attack on the European security architecture,"" he told me. ""I personally believe, and I think many do, that if Putin would be able to conquer Ukraine, he wouldn´t stop there. He would continue to... reinvigorate and re-establish the Soviet Union in all those territories that he believes Russia lost. Moldova is talked about. But I think also he has put his eyes on the Baltic countries.""GettyI think he [Putin] has put his eyes on the Baltic countries.Christoph HeusgenFormer German ambassador to the United NationsIt´s for this reason the EU is now turning its attention, though critics argue not enough, to Moldova and Georgia. Even to Armenia and Azerbaijan.And it´s why the Baltics describe themselves as Europe´s front door. They´ve long called on the West to bolster them in order to protect the continent from an aggressively ambitious Russia.In the snowy wilds of the dense pine forests outside Tallinn, the Estonian capital, I saw for myself how Nato had paid attention.Its presence in the region has been massively increased. A huge military exercise was under way, complete with tanks, Chinook helicopters and trench warfare.The multinational troops I spoke to - from France, the UK, Denmark and of course Estonia - were clear why they were there.""I´m proud to defend Europe,"" Julien, a young French lieutenant, said smilingly.""We are one,"" declared Bernadita, a military planning officer from Copenhagen. ""And an attack against one of us is an attack against all."" But public disengagement we´re seeing in pockets of Europe must give pause for thought. And after the conflict finally ends?Never mind a divided public, there´s no unity even among Europe´s leaders as to how to deal with Russia.Isolate or try to re-integrate, based on the premise that the future security of Europe cannot be meaningfully discussed without Moscow somehow being included? These questions are looming but as yet, unanswered.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyKyivGermanyRussiaEstoniaNatoItalyVladimir PutinEuropean UnionUkraineBerlinMore on this storyBorrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in8 FebruaryWhy Germany delayed sending tanks to Ukraine25 JanuaryOn the front line with engineers fixing Ukraine’s war-ravaged power grid3 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

""If it wasn´t for Putin what would have become of us?""So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. Vladimir Putin´s invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia´s neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. All problems of Titanic proportions.So why did Russia´s president set a course for war and territorial conquest? Image source, EPAImage caption, Mr Putin attended a military ceremony on Thursday to mark Defender of the Fatherland Day""On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,"" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. ""Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?"" Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. The Kremlin had expected its ""special military operation"" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia´s orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine´s capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.Russia´s leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin´s way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?This week he gave us some clues. His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that ""there are battles going on right now on [Russia´s] historical frontiers"" and praised Russia´s ""courageous warriors"".  Conclusion: don´t expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds""If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,"" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin´s former economic adviser. ""There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.""But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  ""It´s possible to sit down with anyone,"" Andrei Illarionov continues, ""but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. ""Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.""When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow´s assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine´s stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: ""Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own security…""  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, On Tuesday the Russian president delivered his annual state-of-the-nation addressPutin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the ""collective West"", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia´s enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia´s economy even more. As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin´s Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia´s Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. ""Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,"" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ""There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there´s a chance to redistribute wealth.""""The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.""Image caption, Newspaper editor Konstantin Remchukov fears Russia is facing civil war""Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?"" I ask Konstantin.""Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.""""And does Putin know these discussions are happening?""""He knows. I think he knows everything.""This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia´s parliament declared: ""As long as there´s Putin, there´s Russia."" It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin´s fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine.

We´ve looked into some of his statements. ´The neo-Nazi regime that set up in Ukraine after 2014´Mr Putin has repeatedly made baseless claims about a ""neo-Nazi regime"" in Ukraine as a justification for Russia´s invasion of the country. In Ukraine´s last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, far lower than in many other European countries.It should also be noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust.But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine - the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From 2022: Ros Atkins on... Putin’s false Nazi claims about UkraineIt was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military.´One of the brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces... was awarded the name Edelweiss, like the Hitler division´Here, Mr Putin drew a comparison between a Ukrainian army unit and the Nazis´ 1st Mountain Division - which had the Edelweiss flower on its insignia and committed war crimes in the Second World War. On 14 February, President Zelensky gave the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade the honorary title: Edelweiss. The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this as ""evidence"" of Nazis in Ukraine in a tweet. But the Edelweiss flower - which grows in Alpine regions - has been used as a symbol by other European mountain military divisions, including the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service, Swiss Army generals and the 21st Rifles Brigade of Poland. Even Russia had a special unit called Edelweiss. The 17th special purpose detachment of Rosgvardia was given this title in 2011. The name was changed to Avanguard in 2016.´We also remember the attempts of the Kyiv regime to acquire nuclear weapons, because they talked about it publicly´There is no evidence that Ukraine has attempted to acquire nuclear weapons, and Mr Putin - who has made this claim before - did not provide any. When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine, but in 1994 Ukraine signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them up, in return for security guarantees. In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested that if Ukraine couldn´t join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status.In 2022, President Zelensky said that although Ukraine had ""abandoned"" its nuclear capabilities, it had ""no security"". But the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them.The UN´s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine ""of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.""Putin´s Ukraine statement fact-checkedPutin´s Victory Day speech fact-checkedFact-checking Russia´s biological weapons claims´GDP in 2022 has decreased by only 2.1% and I´ll remind you that in February or March they predicted a collapse of the Russian economy´Mr Putin is right that the Russian economy has shrunk by less than expected. Russia´s statistics agency says the economy measured by GDP contracted by 2.1%, which is close to the 2.2% estimate in the latest report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).That contraction still makes it the worst-performing country on the IMF´s list, but the organisation confirms that it has contracted by less than expected.The IMF said that Russian trade was being redirected to countries not applying sanctions against it.India and China have become the largest buyers of Russian oil, for example, as Western nations restrict purchases and impose sanctions.In July 2022, the IMF was predicting a 6% contraction in Russian GDP for the year.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaReality CheckVladimir PutinUkraineTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Mr Biden´s first trip to Ukraine as president came days before the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion.  He said that Russia´s President Vladimir Putin had been ""dead wrong"" to think Russia could outlast Ukraine and its Western allies.He met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the pair visited a memorial to soldiers who have died in the nine years since Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces captured parts of the eastern Donbas region. Mr Biden´s presence was intended to reaffirm America´s ""unwavering commitment to Ukraine´s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity"", according to a White House statement. He had taken a 10-hour train journey from Poland to reach Kyiv in secret, later returning to Poland. Russia was informed about the trip a few hours before President Biden´s departure for ""deconfliction purposes"", a US official said. After the visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new package of security assistance for Ukraine valued at $450m (£373m), including ammunition for howitzers and the Himars rocket system, Javelin missiles and air surveillance radars. The US will also provide Kyiv with an extra $10m in emergency assistance to maintain Ukraine´s energy infrastructure, Mr Blinken said.A new wave of sanctions against individuals and companies ""that are trying to evade or backfill Russia´s war machine"" will also be announced later this week. Mr Zelensky said Ukraine´s victory over Russia depended on resolve and that he saw such determination in Mr Biden. ""It is now and in Ukraine that the fate of the world order, which is based on rules, on humanity... is being decided,"" he said.He also said that the two leaders had discussed the possibility of sending other weapons. Mr Zelensky has repeatedly called for F-16 fighter jets, something the US and other allies have so far stopped short of approving.Commenting on the trip, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said failure would befall those who, as she put it, ""sold their souls to the Americans"".In a scene that added drama to the most high-profile visit to Ukraine since the war began, air raid sirens wailed while President Biden and Mr Zelensky were in St Michael´s Cathedral in central Kyiv. The sirens sound regularly in the city.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Biden laid a wreath to commemorate those killed during nine years of conflictWhile other world leaders have visited Ukraine over the past year, the US president´s appearance in Kyiv during a war in which American soldiers are not fighting is a show of unity at a time when Russia says Western support for Ukraine is waning.The visit was welcomed by Ukrainians in Kyiv. ""I´m so grateful for his support - it means so much to us,"" Roksoliana Gera told the BBC. ""I appreciate his courage, that he took on this challenge and came to show the support of the American nation.""Oleksandra Soloviova said the visit showed Russia that ""the US supports us and will continue supporting us, with sanctions and military equipment"". The Ukrainian president´s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the visit had been strategic as well as historic. ""Many issues are being solved and those that have stalled will be accelerated,"" he said.The US is one of Ukraine´s biggest allies and the state department has so far announced $24.9bn in military assistance. In January, Mr Biden announced that the US would send 31 battle tanks and longer-range missiles are also on their way. However, there is a growing political divide in the US over the amount of aid Kyiv should receive in future. President Biden´s visit to Kyiv came ahead of a three-day visit to Poland where he will meet the country´s President, Andrzej Duda, and east European members of the Nato military alliance. In another development, China´s foreign minister has said Beijing is deeply worried by the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the danger it could spiral out of control. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Qin Gang delivered a keynote speech at the Lanting Forum""We will continue to urge peace and promote talks and provide Chinese wisdom for a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine,"" Qin Gang told a forum in Beijing.""Together with the international community, we will jointly promote dialogue, negotiate and address the concerns of all parties and seek common security. In the meantime, we urge certain countries to immediately stop fuelling the fire, stop shifting the blame to China and stop hyping up Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow.""Earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested China was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia for the war - a claim strongly denied by the Chinese.

""It is possible that they may end up being successful in Bakhmut, but it will prove of no real worth to them because it is of no real strategic value,"" Mr Kirby told reporters.Elsewhere, UK intelligence officials have estimated that Russian regular forces and Wagner troops may have suffered between 175,000-200,000 casualties - including 40,000-60,000 deaths.The high number of deaths was ""almost certainly"" due to ""extremely rudimentary medical provision"", the UK´s defence ministry said.The Wagner Group was much smaller before the war, with just 5,000 fighters, most of whom were experienced former soldiers.It started recruiting tens of thousands of fighters last year - largely from prisons, according to the US - as Russia had trouble finding troops for its invasion of Ukraine. Half of those convicts have probably been wounded or killed, UK officials say.But last week, Mr Prigozhin, the group´s founder, announced it would stop recruiting in prisons. The move followed longstanding tensions between Wagner and the Russian military.""The number of Wagner units will decrease, and we will also not be able to carry out the scope of tasks that we would like to,"" he said.Mr Prigozhin has blamed Moscow´s ""monstrous bureaucracy"" for slowing down progress in Ukraine, and accused the Russian army of unfairly taking credit for previous Wagner successes.Wagner is believed to have started operations in 2014 in the annexed Crimean Peninsula and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?23 JanuaryWagner casts doubt on brutal death of ´traitor´13 FebruaryThe migrants forced to fight Russia´s war14 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The United States now says Beijing is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, allegations which China strongly denies.Is China providing Russia with weapons?China has been expanding its military production capabilities and is now the world´s fourth largest arms exporter.""China´s weapons are getting more advanced now,"" says Siemon Wezeman from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. ""Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in.""The US says Chinese firms have already provided ""non-lethal support"" to Russia, and that it has new information suggesting Beijing could soon provide ""lethal support"".Maria Shagina, an expert in economic sanctions at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, says China has not overtly supplied Russia with weapons but may be secretly selling it hi-tech products which could be used for military purposes.""There is evidence that China is the biggest exporter of semiconductors - often through shell companies in Hong Kong and the UAE - to Russia,"" she says.""Some Chinese companies are also supplying civilian drones, exploiting the grey space between military and civilian purposes.""The US-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies says Chinese companies may be sending Russia electronic parts for anti-aircraft missile radars. The US has also imposed sanctions on a Chinese company which Washington says has provided satellite imagery in support of Russian mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine. US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia´s WagnerWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia´s most important trading partnerAfter Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Western nations imposed strict sanctions on Russia - banning imports of oil and exports of hi-tech products.Many Western firms cut their connections with Russia entirely, and its trade with the US, UK, and EU countries slumped over the course of 2022.However, China´s overall trade with Russia hit a record high level of $190bn in 2022 - a 30% increase on the year before.Russian imports from China increased 13% to $76bn and its exports to China increased by 43% to $114bn.As Russia´s trade with Western countries plunged in 2022, China became, by far and away, its most important trading partner.How much oil and gas is China buying from Russia?  Almost half of all the Russian government´s annual revenues come from oil and gas, and its sales to EU countries has plummeted over the past year as sanctions bite.  A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia.Who is buying Russian oil and gasRussia exported twice as much liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to China in 2022 than it did the year before. It also delivered 50% more natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, and 10% more crude oil. The G7 group of economically developed countries, along with the European Union and Australia, has tried to impose a worldwide cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea, but China has refused to comply and buys Russian crude at market prices.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s terminal in Tianjin receives liquified natural gas from RussiaThere are also longer term plans to expand energy ties. The two countries have agreed to build a new gas pipeline (the Power of Siberia 2).

""They said he died a hero,"" says Uliana of 23-year-old Vanya. ""I thought, ´What does it mean, like a hero?´ It´s absurd. I don´t want a dead hero for a brother.""But her father Boris, though also stricken with grief, is proud that his son Vanya died fighting for his country. His view is that the conflict is a battle against ""a government that preaches fascism"". This claim echoes the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who says he is helping to de-Nazify Ukraine and that its government has carried out genocide - a claim for which there is no evidence. ""Before this happened with Vanya, we didn´t discuss the war,"" says Uliana describing her relationship with her father. ""But after he died we had some awful fights about it.""Image source, Anastasia PopovaImage caption, Uliana at her brother Vanya´s funeralIn a new film for BBC Storyville, father and daughter debate the war - a conversation playing out within many families in Russia today.  It is hard to get an accurate picture of exactly how people in the country feel about Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, given legislation which outlaws any comments deemed to discredit the military, or which refer to the military action as a war rather than a ""special military operation"". But a survey published in November 2022 by an independent Russian research group suggests it is dividing generations - 75% of respondents aged 40 and over said they supported the war, compared with 62% of those aged 18-24.Russian filmmaker Anastasia Popova says this chimed with her own perception as she travelled round the country to shoot the documentary. ""I observed lots of different ruptures between families. Their children were mostly against the war, and their parents - the generation brought up during the Soviet Union, who watched [state-run] TV day and night  - supported the war. I have the same rupture within my family,"" she adds, saying her father supports the military action.Relying on state TV for news means absorbing the official narrative of the Russian government day after day. Uliana, and others of her age group, are more likely to get their news from other outlets, such as YouTube and social media. ""´Sorry´ can´t come close to expressing the grief I feel inside,"" says Uliana. She says the war has changed people.""I watch people on the metro [in Moscow]. They read the news, then look away. They´ve stopped looking each other in the eye."" Popova stresses that outside the big cities, support for the war is greater, regardless of the demographic. She says this became clear while she was filming Vanya´s funeral in their home village of Arkhangelskoe, 60 miles [97km] outside Moscow. Uliana speaks of this moment of recognition too. ""When I was watching those people, it came to me that they really believed the words that they were saying,"" she says, ""[which were] that Vanya died like a hero, a true patriot who defended his motherland.""I know that something is wrong. Who are we supposed to be saving there? What are our boys dying for? I never imagined in my life that my brother would be brought to me in a zinc coffin.""Vanya was the youngest of four siblings, and the only son. ""He was a golden boy,"" Uliana says.""He had a broad upbringing,"" Boris explains. ""Art school, music school, sport… I put everything I dreamed of into him.""After leaving home, Vanya joined a literary institute in Moscow to study creative writing and also acted in experimental productions, including at the Bolshoi Theatre. Boris says this led to heartbreak for Vanya, who fell in love with a girl who didn´t want to get married.""This is the theatre world. With its own views of life. Its own ethical and moral criteria. In place of family values, they have open relationships between men and women,"" says Boris.Image source, IvanImage caption, Vanya was heavily involved in the Moscow arts scene before joining the armyUliana says Vanya seemed extremely happy in the theatre, but his father suggests that it provoked some kind of crisis in his son.""He was not satisfied with their view of the world, that they are always negative about Russia; that Russians are nobody to them; that their ancestors, the whole history of Russia is full of nonsense. He understands that he´s not like that. We talked about it. What should he do?""So, Boris says, he and Vanya agreed that he should join the military.""For a life in the creative arts.. you need life experience,"" says Boris. ""Where can you find it? We decided he should follow in the footsteps of the great writers. That´s the army.""Vanya joined the army as a conscript - and then, wanting more interesting challenges, took a military contract. He was a marine based in the city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea when Russia launched its major assault on cities across Ukraine in February last year. He was told to call his family to say goodbye before being sent to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.""We talked for a long time, over an hour,"" says Uliana. ""He had tears in his eyes. I said: ´Vanya, show me what you have there.´ He showed me a machine gun. Like he used to show me toys as a kid.""Boris shows a clip of Vanya´s video message to him. ""Our cause is just,"" Vanya is saying. ""Hello to everyone. I´ll write when I get there. Hugs and kisses.""""Those were his last words,"" Boris says.Storyville - Inside Russia: Traitors and HeroesDespite the huge risks, two Russian filmmakers have been filming the impact of the invasion of Ukraine in their country. Many thousands have fled. Those that have stayed have had to make a choice - oppose the war, support it, or stay silent. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)Viewers outside the UK can watch now, on YouTube (short version)He was killed near the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol on 15 March.His death brought Uliana´s and Boris´s different views on the war into sharp focus. Boris tells Uliana that she is too young to remember what he refers to as the ""brotherhood"" of the Soviet Union republics. He argues that its fall ""broke the psyche of many generations to come, drumming into their heads that the Russians were their enemy"".His language is reminiscent of President Putin, who has called the fall of the Soviet empire the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"". Ukraine declared independence shortly before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.The Russian president also puts blame for the war at the doorstep of Nato and the West, which he argues is trying to weaken and ultimately destroy Russia. Boris follows this narrative too.""In today´s context, ´No to war´ only means one thing,"" Boris tells Uliana. ""It means ´Death to the Russians´. This is a struggle for the Russian world, for the Russian soul, for our culture.""It is clearly not a view held by Uliana although she does, from time to time, waver. Popova captures a moment when Uliana is on holiday in Georgia - one of the few countries Russians can still visit because of sanctions - and she and her friends discuss the war over dinner. Uliana begins to question the facts.""I want to believe that my brother did not die in vain. You want to justify the loss. It´s so painful. You need to hold on to something,"" Uliana explains. A small shrine has been erected in Vanya´s memory in the family home. It includes soil gathered from Mariupol where he died. At times father and daughter have stood before it together.Uliana says that for all their differences she wants to maintain a relationship with her father.""I can´t go to war against my own father. I can´t say ´I hate you because we disagree.´ All I can say is ´Dad, I don´t agree. That´s all I can say.´""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of ""gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation"" since its invasion.Moscow´s ambassador to the US rejected the claims and accused Ms Harris of trying to ""demonise Russia"".World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to ""double down"" on military support.The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. Sunak: Ukraine´s future must be ensured nowMs Harris told delegates that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. ""Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,"" she said. The UN defines crimes against humanity as a ""widespread or systemic attack"" on a particular civilian population.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. Anatoly Antonov, Russia´s ambassador to the US, said the vice-president´s claims were a cynical attempt to ""demonise Russia in the course of a hybrid war"".They were a way of ""justifying Washington´s own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis"", he added, referring to the US supply of arms to Kyiv.But Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, was adamant that ""in the case of Russia´s actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity"".She cited ""barbaric and inhumane"" atrocities committed during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found in Bucha shortly after the invasion and the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol.""Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,"" Ms Harris said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Evidence grows of civilian killings in BuchaCrimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.Ukraine´s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had ""waged a genocidal war"" because it did not think Ukrainians ""deserve to exist as a sovereign nation"".Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin´s invasion.This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It´s a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine´s long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. It´s opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia´s invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.Russia was also on the agenda during a meeting on Saturday between the Antony Blinken and Wang Yi, the US and China´s top foreign policy officials.During talks at the conference in Munich, Mr Blinken warned of consequences if China were to provide material support to Russia´s invasion.Mr Blinken is expected to suggest China is ""at least contemplating providing"" lethal assistance to Russia in an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaInternational Criminal CourtUkraineMore on this storyEvidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha.

When a missile won´t hit as we sleep, as is happening all over Ukraine now,"" Olga tells me in a corner of an abandoned Tesco supermarket.Nearby, her two teenage children lie on camp beds, glued to their phones, with Arnold the dog curled up next to them. The old shopping mall initially sheltered several thousand refugees, fed and supported by volunteers who rushed to the border area to help. Now up to 300 people are allowed to stay two nights at most before moving on.So Olga is taking her children to Germany, where she knows the language a little and hopes to find work.""We used to think about the future and make plans, but people feel lost now. We look to the future and see nothing."" That´s how she describes the mood back home in Slavutych, where she talks of seeing the funerals of too many local young men killed on the frontlines.She had to leave her own eldest son behind, anxious to get his younger brother out of Ukraine before he too turns 18 and becomes eligible to fight. Anna Misniak, who helps run the Przemysl aid centre for the Red Cross, worries that people away from the war zone have become numb to what´s happening after their initial deep shock.""I think people got used to the fact that there is a war and they´ve gone back to normal life. But these people still need help. Their stories are heart-breaking,"" Anna says, as she recalls meeting a woman who had crossed the border in her flip-flops the previous week.Almost four million refugees entered Poland in the first three months of the war. Many have returned home, others moved on to other countries, but about a million are currently registered in this country as refugees.The population of Przemysl alone has increased by roughly 10%, but aid workers, local officials and Ukrainians themselves agree that the warm Polish welcome has not cooled.""The reaction of citizens in Przemysl was incredible,"" local mayor Wojciech Bakun says, adding that a year on, up to 70% of the new arrivals from Ukraine have found work and are renting flats. ""They try to live as normal. That´s very important for us too. They integrate well and I think that´s why we don´t have a disaster in Poland.""That solidarity and support is especially notable in these borderlands, where historic animosity between Poles and Ukrainians is deep-rooted. ""We are writing our own history now. Maybe in 2150, someone will learn about 2022 and how good relations were in this time,"" Mr Bakun suggests.Image source, Bruno Boelpaep/BBCImage caption, People queue on the platform at Przemysl station with free tickets for an evacuation train to Hanover, GermanyFor 11-year-old Sofiya, attending her local Polish school has helped her adjust to life as a refugee. A year after arriving from Kharkiv, close to the Russian border, she joins in her classes with gusto. The government here still gives refugees access to all state benefits including free healthcare and education, although it is phasing out some cash subsidies.Sofiya has learned Polish - ""a mixture of Russian, Ukrainian and some funny words,"" as she puts it - and shows no outward sign of the fear she admits made her ""tremble all over"" when her city came under heavy Russian fire.She and her mother huddled in the basement then with her dog, cat and pet squirrel.""They said it was war, but I didn´t understand at all,"" Sofiya tells me, plucking at her watch strap. ""There were just ´booms´ out on the street.""These days, she says she focuses on her schoolwork.""I try not to think about Ukraine too much and how much I´d like to go back there, because if I do, I´ll burst into tears. I think about what´s happening now, not about the future. That helps calm me down a bit."" Today there are 23 Ukrainian children at Sofiya´s school, about a third of the number attending at the peak, but staff still keep a close eye on them. They´re helped by a foundation called Pro-Fil which takes child psychologists even to remote regions, but says more are needed, especially Ukrainian speakers. ""I help people to live in the here and now and to accept the situation,"" explains Tetiana Boiko, a refugee herself who now works with Pro-Fil. She says that, too, has helped her to cope. ""Yes, there is a war, yes, we are here. But I tell people they need to try to accept that and to take some pleasure from everyday life: the fact they see the sun, the snow, their children. That they´re not in a basement thinking they might die, but can live a full life here and now."" For Olga and her children, Poland is just a transit stop. After one night in the shopping centre shelter, they join the throng at Przemysl station with free tickets for an evacuation train to Hanover. Arnold the dog whimpers on his leash as volunteers shout instructions that few seem to hear or heed.They include an English girl on her Russian-language study year and a Russian man who opposes the war being waged by his country, but can´t protest at home without being arrested.On a wall, there is a plea to help find Murka, a refugee´s pet cat who made it from Ukraine, but escaped her crate during transit.""I´m a bit scared because of the uncertainty over where we´ll end up and how it´ll be,"" Olga admits as she gathers the few belongings the family have brought. ""But the main thing is that we´re safe.""The volunteers then help the refugees drag their cases along the cold, dark platform and on to the busy train for another journey into the unknown.""It´s still hard to believe this is happening. Even though everyone is kind and good, it´s a real stress. The fact is, we´re not at home.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkraineUkrainian refugeesPolandMore on this story´We´re safe here but always thinking of home´12 January´Every Ukrainian has a battlefield - the stage is ours´1 JanuaryDefying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´4 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Speaking to French media, Mr Macron urged Western nations to increase military support for Kyiv and said he was prepared for a protracted war.""I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,"" he said.But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to ""crush"" the nation.The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.""I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,"" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.""Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position."" Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to ""bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace"".He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, describing similar efforts around the world as a ""total failure"".Despite Mr Macron´s comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine´s leaders.On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the ""terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics"", he said.President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was ""no trust"" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also dismissed the idea of giving up territory to strike a peace deal with Moscow.Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.Last June, he was condemned by Mr Kuleba for saying it was vital that Russia was not ""humiliated over its invasion"".Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was ""humiliating itself"" - needed to be put in its place.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaEmmanuel MacronVladimir PutinMore on this storyUkraine anger as Macron says ´Don´t humiliate Russia´4 June 2022Russia has committed crimes against humanity - US19 FebruarySunak: Ukraine´s future must be ensured now18 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Ukraine said on Thursday it had secured the release of 1,863 men and women in prisoner swaps since the full-scale invasion began. These are highly sensitive operations, often taking months to arrange.Under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war must not be paraded or exposed to the public.We were allowed to approach who we wanted and asked for their consent. But the guards were with us wherever we went and these men were unlikely to have been speaking freely.Many hid their faces to further protect their identities.Image caption, The Ukrainian guards said the prisoners were permitted one phone call every two weeksLast November, a UN human rights report documented abuses by both sides, based on interviews with prisoners who spoke of cases of torture and ill-treatment.Here the guards appeared keen to show they were treating the prisoners well.One fighter said he had been working for a mercenary group. He had been brought to this facility three days earlier, after he was taken prisoner near the eastern town of Soledar, which was captured last month by Russian forces.A handful stared on defiantly. We met the gaze of one prisoner who said he was captured in the Luhansk region on 29 December. ""I hope I will be exchanged and that I won´t have to go back into the army,"" he said.""What if you have no choice?"" I asked.He paused for a second: ""I have some ideas. I could come back by surrendering voluntarily.""Leaving the shelter it became clear that half the prisoners had been wounded. Some had bandaged hands or feet. Others would move with a heavy limp.One young man became emotional as he described how he had lost his leg in a grenade explosion.Image caption, In one workshop at the facility, Russian soldiers were constructing garden furnitureAs we approached the pulsing sound of a compression drill, a small production line came into view where prisoners of war were putting together outdoor furniture sets.They worked, again with their heads down.A local company had a contract with the facility, we were told, and that meant the inmates could make some money too, mostly to spend on cigarettes and sweets.Most prisoners of war are compelled to have jobs like this. Apparently only Russian officers had a choice.At lunchtime the prisoners were marched to a temporary canteen on the top floor. Through the window a Ukrainian flag flapped in the cold wind. They ate quickly and in silence, but for the sound of eating. Then, table by table, in a moment of perfect choreography, they stood together and shouted in Ukrainian: ""Thank you for lunch!"" Image caption, The prisoners eat a lunch of bread, corn soup, and a bowl of barley and meatInmates here are made to watch TV in Ukrainian, including documentaries on Ukrainian history and the southern city of Mariupol, which was all but flattened by a Russian siege and bombardment that lasted for months.Some of the Ukrainian soldiers who had defended Mariupol were part of the last exchange.We asked one inmate whether he understood what he was watching. ""More or less,"" he said. ""I find it educational."" He was unlikely to have said anything unflattering.It is quite possible that some of the Russians in the room could not understand the programme they were having to watch, and they may not have wanted to.The prisoners are allowed one phone call every two weeks, according to the guards. For their families back in Russia these calls are often the first chance they have to find out their sons have been captured.""Where are you? I´ve asked half the city about you!"" one young man´s mother could be heard over the phone.""Mum, wait. I´m in captivity, I can´t say more."" ""With the bloody Ukrainians?"" she said, before breaking down in tears.""That´s it, Mum. Quiet,"" he told her, as the guard stood over him. ""The most important thing is that I´m alive and healthy.""  Some of the prisoners´ calls went unanswered, leaving them hoping for another chance on the phone - and a future prisoner swap.Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Morgan Gisholt Minard.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyThe migrants forced to fight Russia´s war14 FebruaryRussian army officer: Our troops tortured Ukrainians2 FebruaryThe shelled Russian border town backing Putin´s war10 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Ukraine´s railways have been under attack by rockets and cruise missiles since Vladimir Putin invaded last year.Despite damage, trains have provided a lifeline to military efforts and assisted four million evacuees to flee.The UK Government has pledged £10m worth of material and rail equipment.It is hoped the aid package, which includes rapid-build modular steel bridges and tunnel-lining repair equipment, will help get Ukraine´s railways up and running faster.The first aid shipment supplied by British engineering firm Mabey Bridge in Lydney, Gloucestershire, with Network Rail and the Department for Transport, has already been delivered to Ukraine via Poland.A group of Ukrainian engineers also travelled to England in January to learn how to assemble the pre-engineered bridges before being flown home to train their own teams.Image source, Jacob King/PA WireImage caption, Transport Secretary Mark Harper (centre) and Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine Ambassador to the UK, talk to a Ukrainian engineerDuring a visit to Mabey Bridge HQ with Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said it was a ""really important project where Mabey Bridge and Network Rail are working together to support the Ukrainian railway system which has come under attack from Putin´s illegal war in Ukraine"".""It´s really clear the importance of this, and that this is going to make a difference in helping to get their railway working again,"" Mr Harper added.One Ukrainian engineer said: ""There´s no doubt that the support we´re getting from our British colleagues will assist us in rebuilding the railway and connecting our country"".Mr Harper said the support given to Ukrainians was part of ""our bigger effort in making sure that the Ukrainians win this war against Russia"".Last year the UK provided £2.3bn in military aid to Ukraine - the largest package of support of any European nation and second only to the United States.´Such a difference´Michael Treacy, head of Mabey Bridge, which specialises in accelerated bridge construction in military settings, said a lack of transport links can have ""a huge effect on people´s lives"".""When people think of aid they might not automatically think of bridges, but getting people their transport systems back makes such a difference,"" he said.Engineers were able to build one of the bridges destined for Ukraine in two-and-a-half days.Mr Treacy said even considering the other work around the bridge build, it would take a ""maximum of two weeks to have the bridge back in service on a railway that´s been broken or bombed"".He said a traditional bridge made from concrete could take months or even years to build.""That´s one of the real benefits to these bridges, because speed is of the essence here,"" he said.Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said because the bridges can last a couple of decades or more, it would also help with the reconstruction of Ukraine afterwards.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Mr Zelensky also said a predicted spring offensive had already begun.""Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,"" he said. He does, however, believe Ukraine´s forces can keep resisting Russia´s advance until they are able to launch a counter-offensive - although he repeated his calls for more military aid from the West.""Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands,"" Mr Zelensky told the BBC.He met UK and EU leaders last week in a bid to bolster international support and to ask for modern arms to defend his country. When Ukraine´s president asked for modern fighter jets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""nothing is off the table"".But Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated with the speed with which Western weapons have arrived. Deliveries of battle tanks - promised last month by a swathe of Western countries, including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.President Zelensky also addressed a threat by Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a single Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. ""I hope [Belarus] won´t join [the war],"" he said. ""If it does, we will fight and we will survive."" Allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack again would be a ""huge mistake"", he added.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Zelensky warns Belarus against helping Russian offensiveRussian forces launched part of their full-scale invasion from Belarus 12 months ago. They drove south towards Ukraine´s capital Kyiv but were fought back and made to retreat within weeks, after suffering heavy casualties.When asked if he was surprised by Russia´s tactics in the war, Mr Zelensky described them as ""valueless"".""The way they destroyed everything. If their soldiers received [and carried out] those orders, that means they share those same values.""Ukrainian data released this week suggested Russian troops in Ukraine were dying in greater numbers this month than at any time since the first week of their invasion. The figures cannot be verified, but the UK´s Ministry of Defence said the trends were ""likely accurate"".""Today, our survival is our unity,"" said Mr Zelensky on how he thought the war will end. ""I believe Ukraine is fighting for its survival."" His country was moving towards Europe economically, as well as through its values, he said.""We chose this path. We want security guarantees. Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state.""""It´s not about compromise itself,"" he said. ""Why would we be afraid of that? We have millions of compromises in life every day.""The question is with whom? With Putin? No. Because there´s no trust. Dialogue with him?

She has an electronic tag on her leg. Police can monitor her every move. Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October´s explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea.""I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,"" Olesya tells the BBC, ""reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened."" She had also shared a friend´s post about the war.Then the drama began.""I was talking on the phone to my mother,"" Olesya recalls, ""when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor.""Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison.Image caption, Olesya is only allowed to leave home to attend court""I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,"" Olesya says. ""I´d seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn´t paid much attention and continued to speak out.""A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia´s official list of terrorists and extremists. ""When I realised I´d been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,"" recalls Olesya. Under the rules of her house arrest she´s banned from talking on the phone and going online.Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: ""Big Brother is watching you.""It appears that in Olesya´s case, it wasn´t Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students.Image caption, Her anti-Putin tattoo reads: ""Big Brother is watching you.""""A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,"" Olesya says, ""about how I was against the ´special military operation´. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities.""The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat.In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing ""provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud"". ""First let´s try to discredit her. If she doesn´t get it, let the security services deal with it.""""Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,"" someone else writes.Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat.It´s one year since the Kremlin launched its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia´s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate ""true patriots from scum and traitors"".Since then, across Russia there have been reports of Soviet-style denunciations against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues. BBCThey can´t put everyone in prison. At some point they´ll run out of cellsOlesya KrivtsovaRussian studentPublic criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people´s criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don´t support it, at the very least you´re expected to stay silent. If you don´t stay silent, there´s a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading ""false information"" about the military and ""discrediting"" the army.In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: ""Being a warrior means living forever."" The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments. ""People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they´re sick in the head,"" Konstantin tells me. ""They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder."" Image caption, Patriotic, pro-war messaging is everywhere in Russia""I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,"" Ekaterina tells me. But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn´t that harsh? I ask.""People should use their brains,"" Ekaterina replies. ""If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they´re patriots, they need to abide by the law.""Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement. Olesya´s T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with ""School Bus"" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities.The judge rules to keep her under house arrest.""The state doesn´t have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,"" Olesya says. ""But they can´t put everyone in prison. At some point they´ll run out of cells.""Produced by Liza Shuvalova.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyBakhmut: ´Little by little, the Russians are winning´12 FebruaryThe shelled Russian border town backing Putin´s war10 FebruaryRussian army officer: Our troops tortured Ukrainians2 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But the growing number of casualties and extrajudicial executions make it much harder to find volunteers, even in prisons. Many convicts are now worried that they can be simply forced to go to war - and migrant workers from Central Asian countries find themselves particularly vulnerable.Anuar came to Russia in search of work in 2018. He was later imprisoned for drug trafficking and sent to serve his term at Penal Colony Number Six in Vladimir region. The BBC is not disclosing his real name and citizenship for safety reasons.  At the end of January, he told his father that a group of Central Asians had been sent to fight in Ukraine without their consent. ""There are lots of Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz there in that prison. Now they are planning to send another group and my son is worried that they will force him to go too,"" Anuar´s father told the BBC.   The BBC has seen court documents and Anuar´s letters which confirm he is indeed serving his sentence in that prison. And his story about the group that was forced to go to Ukraine in January is also corroborated by Olga Romanova, director of the civil rights organisation Russia Behind Bars. Parents of those prisoners approached her for help.  ""They were not given a choice. They were told to sign the contract and were sent to the front line like a bag of potatoes,"" Ms Romanova said.  Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Parents of prisoners have approached Olga Romanova for helpInitially, the parents were willing to go to court so that their children wouldn´t end up in Ukraine, she says. But then they refused to, out of fear of the punishment their children could face if they stayed in prison. Penal Colony Number Six is notorious for its ill-treatment and frequent beatings of convicts. Olga Romanova described it as ""a torture prison"". It´s where Alexei Navalny, the prominent Russian opposition figure, is being held.  The colony´s administration has not replied to the BBC´s request to respond to the allegations that they forced prisoners to sign military contracts.  Recruitment in prisons appears to have been very successful, but things are changing as the Wagner group is suffering heavy losses on the battlefield. BBC Uzbek has spoken to Farukh (not his real name), a citizen of Uzbekistan who is in prison in Russia´s Rostov region. Several of his fellow inmates joined Wagner. First it was voluntary, Farukh said, but now he´s worried that prisoners may be forced to go to war.  ""In the beginning, I also considered going because everyone thought that Russia was more powerful, that Russia would win - maybe in one month, three months or in one year. But now we see how many people are dying there and if they are short of soldiers - it´s not good. If they tell me to go and I refuse, then they can declare that I am against Russia.""  Central Asian citizens are recruited to fight for Russia in other ways too, not just in prisons. Overall, there are about 10.5 million migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia, according to the latest statistics from the Russian Interior Ministry. And that´s a massive resource for military headhunters to tap.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wagner has reportedly recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to fight in UkraineRussian authorities openly sign up people to join the armed forces at the migration centre in Moscow. There are even ads in Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik languages offering citizens of these countries a fast track to obtain a Russian passport if they join the armed forces.  But activists say that it´s not always voluntary. Migrant rights defender Valentina Chupik told the BBC that police officers sometimes stopped Central Asian migrants on the street and intimidated them into signing a military contract. They were told that otherwise they would get deported, Ms Chupik said.Many labour migrants lack proper work permits, live at a place other than where they´re registered, or violate other migration rules. And that´s why they can be an easy target for recruiters. Aziz, not his real name, who has dual Russian and Tajik citizenship, told the BBC he was detained during a police raid at the construction site where he works. He was told he´d be taken to a police station to check his ID but instead, he ended up at a military enlistment office. When he started shouting at police officers demanding why they had lied to him, they twisted his arms and threw him back into the bus.  Eventually they released him. But many migrants in Russia are too afraid of law enforcement officers to object to being signed up for the war.Related TopicsKazakhstanRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUzbekistanKyrgyzstanVladimir PutinTajikistanUkraineMore on this storyBorrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in8 FebruaryRussian army officer: Our troops tortured Ukrainians2 FebruaryFive ways Ukraine war could go in 202327 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

It appeared to show Yakushchenko being hit fatally with a sledgehammer.Mr Prigozhin joked about that video in reply to an inquiry from Russian news outlet Ostorozhno Media about Yakushchenko´s true fate.""Ksenia, don´t treat everything so gloomily. The kids are having fun,"" the Wagner chief wrote enigmatically. He said the case was not a one-off drama, but more like the hit Soviet-era TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, a thriller set in World War Two. ""You know, good always triumphs over evil,"" he added.Yakushchenko´s current circumstances are unclear - and there is no confirmation that he is still alive, despite Mr Prigozhin´s message on Telegram. Yakushchenko may have returned to Wagner via a prisoner exchange, but that has not been confirmed. In the first video on Monday, released on the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone, he admitted having fled to the Ukrainian side, before being kidnapped and ending up as a prisoner of Wagner.The apparent sledgehammer ""execution"", filmed in a cellar, was presented as the ""trial of a traitor"". It was similar to a brutal killing shown in a Wagner video three months ago, again involving a soldier accused of defecting to the Ukrainians.Wagner calls itself a ""private military company"" (PMC) and has thousands of troops involved in heavy fighting in Ukraine.It began operations in 2014 in Crimea and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.In the second video on Monday, Yakushchenko said: ""In Wagner PMC, everyone has the right to correct their mistakes. ""When I was captured, I said all sorts of garbage and I´m still ashamed, but it was the only way to survive. Upon return from captivity, I brought lots of valuable information that saved the lives of many guys, so I was forgiven, for which I am very grateful.""Neither video indicated where or when the filming took place, nor was that clear from the accompanying text posts.Warning: you may find the description below upsettingGrey Zone named the alleged ""traitor"" as Crimea-born Dmitry Yakushchenko, 44, who defected to Ukraine four days after becoming a Wagner fighter.The first part of the video showed him in Ukrainian captivity - the BBC has established that the clip came from Ukrainian channel Espreso.TV. In it, Yakushchenko suggested that Crimea might return to Ukraine´s control in a couple of years.According to the text, he had been jailed earlier for murder, but had seized the chance to fight for Wagner in order to leave jail. Wagner is known to have recruited men from Russian prisons.The video then cuts to a shot of Yakushchenko sitting in a cellar with his head taped to construction debris set against a stone wall. Another man is standing behind him holding a sledgehammer. A caption calls the scene ""trial for treachery"".At the point where the first hammer blow is struck, the video goes blurred and Yakushchenko falls backwards. Further blows are struck, then a caption reads ""the court session is adjourned"".Image source, AFPImage caption, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin rose to prominence as head of a catering businessThe Grey Zone post makes a sarcastic comment about Yakushchenko´s apparent death, referring back to Wagner´s November ""execution"" of Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was also a former prison inmate. ""Like his colleague Yevgeny Nuzhin earlier, he caught the same disease that makes you lose consciousness in Ukrainian cities, earlier in Kyiv, now in Dnipro, and then wake up in a basement at your last court session,"" the post said.In depth: War in UkrainePowerful ´Putin´s chef´ cooks up murky dealsThe shadowy mercenary group has adopted a more public profile since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago - even opening a big headquarters in St Petersburg. Yevgeny Prigozhin, for years a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been nicknamed ""Putin´s chef"" for providing catering services for the Russian elite and armed forces. But he has given Wagner credit for the offensive on Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, downplaying the Russian army´s role, and suggesting that his forces are more competent fighters.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaMore on this storyWagner chief defends brutal killing video14 November 2022Putin allies who criticise Russia´s war machine8 November 2022Watch: Russian mercenary group recruits detainees15 September 2022Powerful ´Putin´s chef´ cooks up murky deals4 November 2019Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Move fast. Single file. Just a few at a time.""The staccato instructions come from the Ukrainian army escort taking us to a military position in battle-scarred Bakhmut, a city once famed for its sparkling wines.Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the eastern city ""our fortress"". Russian forces have spent the past six months trying to capture Bakhmut. Now they have intensified their onslaught - Ukraine believes - to tear it down ahead of the anniversary of the invasion. We follow orders, darting down an icy rubble-strewn street, with a clear blue sky overhead - ideal for Russian drones.Just after we cross the road, two Russian shells come slamming down behind us on the other side. We turn around to see black smoke rising and keep on running. Was the shelling random or aimed at us? We can´t be sure, but everything that moves in Bakhmut is a target - soldier or civilian.  For hours there is no let-up in the shelling, incoming and outgoing. A Russian fighter jet roars overhead. The nearest Russian troops are just two kilometres away. There is street fighting in some areas, but Ukrainian forces still hold the city - despite sub-zero temperatures and dwindling ammunition. ""We have some shortages of ammunition of all kinds, especially artillery rounds,"" says Capt Mykhailo from the 93rd Mechanised Brigade, whose call sign is ´Polyglot´. ""We also need encrypted communication devices from our Western allies, and some armoured personnel carriers to move troops around. But we still manage. One of the main lessons of this war is how to fight with limited resources.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Capt Mykhailo says Ukrainian forces have to work with limited resourcesWe get an insight into the ammunition problems as Ukrainian troops target a Russian position with 60mm mortars. The first mortar round flies from the tube with a loud bang. The second round doesn´t eject. There´s a hiss of smoke and a shout of ""misfire"" sending the mortar unit scrambling for cover. Troops tell us the ammunition is old stock, sent from abroad.The battle for Bakhmut is a war within a war. Some of the fiercest fighting of the invasion has happened here. And now the Kremlin´s forces are gaining ground, metre by metre, body by body. Wave after wave of mercenaries from the notorious Wagner group have been sent into battle here. There are reports of fields of Russian corpses.Moscow now has effective control of both main roads into the city, leaving just one back route left - a slender supply line.  ""They have been trying to take the city since July,"" says Iryna, press officer of the 93rd Brigade. ""Little by little they are winning now. They have more resources, so if they play the long game they will win. I can´t say how long it will take. ""Maybe they will run out of resources. I really hope so.""  We move from carefully concealed firing positions to bunkers humming with generators and warmed by stoves. But troops take care to conceal any smoke which could give away their location - part of the housekeeping of war. Among those we meet there is calm determination to fight on. ""They are trying to encircle us so that we leave the city, but it´s not working,"" says Ihor, a camouflage-clad commander, with a battle-hardened edge. ""The city is under control. Transport moves, despite constant artillery strikes. Of course, we have losses from our side, but we are holding on. We only have one option - to keep going to victory.""BBCWe only have one option - to keep going to victoryIhorUkrainian soldier in BakhmutThere is another option - to withdraw from Bakhmut before it´s too late. But among the defenders on the ground there seems little appetite for that. ""If we have such an order from our HQ, OK, order is order,"" says Captain Myhailo. ""But what sense to hold all these months if you need to retreat from this city? No, we don´t want to do this."" He recalls those who have given their lives for Bakhmut - ""a lot of good brave men who just love this country.""And if the defenders of Bakhmut were to withdraw, it would pave the way for Russia to push towards bigger cities in eastern Ukraine like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Moscow has stepped up its attacks in other front-line areas in the Donbas region in the east, and in the south. Ukrainian officials say a new Russian offensive is already under way.The Kremlin is on a clock, as it counts down to the anniversary on 24 February. ""They are mad about dates and so-called ´victory days´,"" says Capt Mykhailo.  But the battle of attrition for Bakhmut could wear out the Russians, according to Viktor, a tall, lean Ukrainian commander who has captured Russian magazines on a shelf in his bunker.""They don´t defend now,"" he says, ""they just attack. They continue taking some metres, but we are trying to make sure they take as little of our land as possible.  We are holding the enemy here and wearing them out.""Perhaps. There is still some life in Bakhmut if you know where to find it.A blast of heat and light hits you when you walk through the door of the ""invincibility hub"", past boxes of donated food supplies. It´s a boxing club turned life-support system where local people can recharge their phones and themselves, with hot food and companionship.Image source, BBC/Goktay KoraltanImage caption, There are still civilians living among the rubble of BakhmutIt was crowded when we visited, with elderly women clustered around a stove, and two young boys sitting in the boxing ring, glued to a TV screen, and playing war games.Around 5,000 civilians remain in Bakhmut without running water or power - many are elderly and poor. ""Some are pro-Moscow. They are waiting for the Russians,"" a Ukrainian colleague mutters darkly.   All here are fighting their own battles says Tetiana, a 23-year-old psychologist who is at the hub watching over her young brother and sister. She´s still in Bakhmut because her 86-year-old grandmother can´t move and relies on her.""Most people deal with it by praying to God,"" she says. ""Faith helps. Some forget that they are people. Some show aggression. They start behaving worse than animals.""Back outside the battle for this broken city rages on, with a drum beat of shelling as we leave.Almost one year on since the start of the conflict, what questions do you have about the war in Ukraine?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

I hear explosions in the distance. But no-one flinches. Just metres away other stalls have been reduced to twisted metal. They were hit by a mortar a few days before. At the time the market was shut, so no-one was hurt. But many stalls remain closed and there´s only a handful of customers. Sandbags are stacked up outside some of the buildings. In many parts of Russia this feels like a virtual war: a conflict being played out on television, far from home. But in Russia´s Belgorod region war feels very real and very close. Raisa Alexandrovna, who sells sweets here, has lost her sense of security. ""No-one´s protecting us,"" Raisa tells me. ""When people go home at night, they don´t know if they´ll still be in one piece in the morning.""Everyone I speak to at the market tells me they live in fear of Ukrainian shelling. But they omit to mention that it was their country that invaded Ukraine. Image caption, A number of stalls at the market have been hit by mortarsThey confirm that, one year, ago, life here was quiet and peaceful. Yet, they decline to join the dots and blame the Kremlin for what has transpired.""We had to start this military operation,"" Raisa insists. ""It´s the right thing. We just should have been better prepared for it. We should have drafted people into the army right away. So many of our young men are dying. There´ll be no one left for our women to marry.""""But what about the Ukrainians who´ve been killed because of Russia´s invasion?"" I ask. ""Yes, people on both sides have been killed,"" replies Raisa. ""But the minds of Ukrainians have been altered. A new generation has grown up there hating Russians. We need to re-educate them. Re-make them.""In the city of Belgorod, the regional capital, a giant letter ´Z´ - the symbol of Russia´s military operation - has been erected along a busy highway. In recent months there have been explosions, too, in Belgorod, including at the airport, an oil depot and an apparent strike on a power plant. Suddenly residents are having to think about where to take cover. Shelters have been opened in cellars and in basements of apartment blocks.  Image caption, Belgorod is full of billboards and slogans supporting Russian soldiersConversations here run similar to those at the market, with most people telling me: yes, security only became a problem after the invasion, but, no, they don´t blame the invasion itself. It´s as if there´s a psychological firewall preventing people from connecting the deteriorating security situation to the decision of their president.If there is a firewall, patriotic messaging feeds it. Staring down from billboards and advertising hoardings in Belgorod are the portraits of decorated Russian soldiers who´ve been fighting in Ukraine. The images and slogans encourage the public to rally round the flag.""Thank you for your heroic deeds!"" reads one poster.""For the Motherland!"" declares another. ""Everything for the front line! Everything for victory!""""Believe in Yourself, but Live for Russia!"" In addition to the slogans on the street, there´s also the propaganda on Russian state TV. From morning till night news bulletins and talk shows assure viewers that Russia is in the right; that Ukraine and the West are the aggressors and that in this conflict the very future of Russia is at stake.The messaging works. In a Belgorod knitting shop, I get chatting to the owner. He clearly believes that, by criticising Russia, the West is pulling the wool over everyone´s eyes.""The West plays a negative role,"" he tells me. ""It obviously wants to destroy Russia. We´ve seen that before. Under Adolf Hitler.""Outside the shop, law student Ksenya agrees.""Ukraine is a Western puppet,"" Ksenya says, ""and the West has always wanted to destroy Russia. Hitler wanted to grab our land. Who doesn´t? We have such an enormous country.""Not everyone shares that view but few are willing to admit it in public.""I don´t believe I can influence the situation,"" says Ivan, further up the street. ""I understand which country I´m living in and what the authorities have done to prevent ordinary people from expressing their opinions. Any such expression is dangerous."" Image caption, Sandbags protect a number of buildings now throughout the Russian border townReferences to Hitler are not accidental. You hear them all the time on Russian TV. To spark patriotic fervour and boost public support for the ""special military operation,"" the Kremlin paints the war in Ukraine in similar colours as World War Two: as Russia fighting fascism, battling to defend the Motherland from foreign invaders. The reality is very different. In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In 2022 Vladimir Putin´s Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In wasteland outside Belgorod I see first-hand how connections to World War Two are being created. A group of armed men have agreed to meet me. They call themselves ""Smersh"" (""Death to Spies"") after a notorious counter-intelligence unit created by Joseph Stalin in World War Two. They will not reveal their faces - or their names - but will talk briefly about their activities.""At the moment we are training a territorial defence force for Belgorod region,"" one man says. ""Some of those in training have experience in fighting. Some are former police and ex-military. They will defend Belgorod region if there is an attack on Russia. As for us, we will carry out any task the commander-in-chief may give us, in any town, anywhere in the world.""BBCUkrainians are Russians. They´ve just forgotten about it.Evgeny BakaloBusinessman in BelgorodAmong the men being trained is Evgeny Bakalo, a local writer and businessman. In Belgorod Evgeny has set up a support group for Ukrainians who´ve crossed into Russia to escape the war. Mr Bakalo´s opinion of Ukraine chimes with the controversial views of President Putin.""We´re one people,"" he tells me. ""Ukrainians are Russians. They´ve just forgotten about it."" A year of war and fierce Ukrainian resistance suggest the opposite: that now, more than at any other time in its post-Soviet history, the Ukrainian people value their sovereignty and independence and are determined not to be forced back into Moscow´s orbit. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to portray Ukrainian officials as neo-Nazis and Western governments as Nazi sympathisers: another reason for the Kremlin´s frequent references to the 1940s. Under President Putin, the national idea is constructed around World War Two - what most Russians refer to as the Great Patriotic War: both the Soviet Union´s victory in that war, and the enormous human cost of that victory. It is a hugely emotive subject.Image caption, Olga´s husband has volunteered to fight for RussiaOlga, who runs a church choir in Belgorod, tells me she is ""very frightened"" when the city is being shelled. When I suggest to her that this wouldn´t be happening if the ""special military operation"" hadn´t started, her immediate reaction is to reference World War Two.""I return us to the Great Patriotic War,"" Olga tells me, ""which was a time of great sacrifice. There are always sacrifices being made. When our men go off to fight they know they may be killed.""Olga´s husband isn´t at home. He´s volunteered to fight in the ""special military operation"". She accepts the official view - the version of events that much of the world dismisses as the Kremlin´s alternative reality.""Russia didn´t provoke this war,"" Olga tells me. ""A Russian will give you the shirt off his back. Russia didn´t attack Ukraine. Russians are peace-loving and generous.""Produced by Will VernonRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyBorrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in8 FebruaryRussian army officer: Our troops tortured Ukrainians2 FebruaryFive ways Ukraine war could go in 202327 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions - breaking policies set out by SpaceX.A Ukrainian official said companies had to choose which ""side"" they were on.They could join Ukraine and ""the right to freedom"", or pick Russia and ""its ´right´ to kill and seize territories"", tweeted presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.At an event in Washington DC on Wednesday, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell explained that Starlink technology was ""never meant to be weaponised"".She made reference to Ukraine´s alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use.Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow´s own drone attacks.Russia has been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology ""for comms"", but said her intent was ""never to have them use it for offensive purposes"".She said the company had taken steps to ""limit"" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details. The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year. What is Starlink and how does it work?After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media.The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected.They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit.As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments.In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position.In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work. ""SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,"" he wrote. ""However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don´t part.""

During a regular call with journalists, Dmitry Peskov told the BBC it was a matter for the defence ministry, which is yet to comment.Moldova´s country´s defence ministry described the missile flyover as a ""violation"", and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation - having done the same following a similar incident in October.The incident occurred on a day of political turbulence in Chisinau, during which the whole government resigned.For its part, Romania insisted that Russian missiles had not strayed into its airspace ""at any time"".But Mr Zelensky doubled down on the Ukrainian military´s Romanian claim, writing that the Russian missiles posed questions for ""collective security"". In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he added there were ""victims"" of the assault, without specifying a number.The Ukrainian air force said 71 missiles were fired in Friday´s ""massive"" attack, of which it shot down 61.In the aftermath, an aide of Mr Zelensky reiterated a call for the West to donate fighter jets, and criticised ""political hesitation"" over the provision of new arms to his country.Mr Zelensky himself had spent the previous day meeting EU leaders and appealing for planes to be sent - following another visit to the UK for the same purpose.Ukraine is suffering blackouts after energy facilities were targeted in six regions.Some 150,000 homes were without electricity in the eastern Kharkiv region alone, and seven people were injured, officials said. Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, although the city´s mayor said nobody was hurt. Residents sheltered in the capital´s metro system, and school lessons were reportedly held in one station.Other regions, including Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, also came under fire, and the governor of Mykolaiv region described at least three ""waves"" of missiles.Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine´s energy facilities over the winter, and Ukraine´s state energy firm described Friday´s assault as the fourteenth of its kind. Such attacks have been described by some analysts as war crimes, although Russia denies intentionally harming civilians. Energy workers in the country have increasingly dangerous jobs - and 98 of them lost their lives while performing their duties last year, an official recently told Latvian media.

Poland´s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act ""within the entire formation of Nato"", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv´s request for jets quickly.In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc´s leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years.""Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,"" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the ""biggest anti-European force of the modern world"". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine.The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France´s Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany´s Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table.Image source, Mohammed Badra/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, Ukraine´s leader travelled with President Macron to Brussels ahead of the EU summitMr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be ""game-changers"" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, ""the quicker this Russian aggression will end"", he explained.Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not.The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France ""determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights"". Chancellor Scholz added: ""The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war.""Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results.He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was ""very little time"" to provide much-needed weaponry.The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. ""The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,"" Mr Rutte told the BBC.Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls ""provocations"".  Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict.""We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,"" said Mr Peskov.Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a ""public bidding war"" of weapons systems for Ukraine.The profound questions Zelensky’s European tour posesPM tells Zelensky nothing off table after jet pleaThe key Ukrainian cities in Russia’s sightsMr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: ""Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose."" Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was ""a long-term solution"" and that training pilots could take years.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyGermanyOlaf ScholzEmmanuel MacronUkraineMore on this storyThe profound questions Zelensky’s European tour poses9 FebruaryPM tells Zelensky nothing off table after jet plea8 FebruaryThe key Ukrainian cities in Russia’s sights6 FebruaryView commentsTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Russia is usually represented at the event, as the camp in occupied Poland was liberated by the Soviet Army.But this year, following Moscow´s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum declined to invite Russian officials and its director likened the Ukraine war to the horrors of the Holocaust.In response, Russia accused the museum of attempting to ""rewrite history"". At the event on Friday, museum director Piotr Cywinski said Auschwitz was created by Nazi ""megalomania"" and a ""similar sick megalomania"" and ""similar lust for power"" had driven Russia´s destruction of Mariupol and Donetsk. Speaking to an audience including camp survivors, he warned that ""once again, innocent people are being killed en masse in Europe"".""Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it. We see it every day, even as we stand here. And so it is difficult to stand here today.""Reacting to the decision, Russia said Soviet soldiers who freed Auschwitz would not be forgotten. ""No matter how our European ´non-partners´ contrived in their attempts to rewrite history in a new way, the memory of the Soviet heroes-liberators and horrors of Nazism cannot be erased,"" Russia´s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a pointed social media post.Auschwitz survivors also expressed their fears over the fallout of the war in Ukraine at the event.Polish survivor Zdzislawa Wlodarczyk said she was ""scared to hear what is happening in the East"".She told the audience that she had arrived in Auschwitz as an 11-year-old following the Warsaw Uprising, a failed attempt by the Polish resistance in 1944 to liberate the city from the German occupiers.She and her 7-year-old brother remained in the camp until the Soviet army liberated it.""The Russian armies that liberated us are now waging war on Ukraine. Why? Why? That´s what politics is,"" she said.The Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour.Russian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia´s top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday.The Russian leader said he was ""pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again"".Russia´s Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that ""these political games have no place on Holocaust day"".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar attends a candle lighting ceremony at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Centre in MoscowHe told AFP: ""For us, this is clearly a humiliation because we perfectly know and remember the role of the Red [Soviet] Army in the liberation of Auschwitz and in the victory over Nazism.""Friday´s event marks the 78th anniversary of the Soviet army liberating the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than one million people were murdered by the Nazis. Auschwitz-Birkenau was created as a part of the Holocaust, a process that started with discrimination against Jewish people, and ended with six million Jews being killed because of who they were.In total, 1.1 million people died in the camp, around one million Jews from across Europe as well as Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma and Sinti.

Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward.The head of Russia´s Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell.The key Ukrainian cities in Russia’s sightsUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia´s attempt to encircle Bakhmut. ""We are countering them,"" he said on Monday night.He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could ""prove themselves"" against current threats from Russia.Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation. Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle.Almost a year into Russia´s invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine´s front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.Mr Haidai said the Russians´ two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove.President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia´s expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range.The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and ""could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation"".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyUkraine braced for new Russian offensive this month6 FebruaryLife in a liberated town under fear of Russian attack22 JanuaryRussia planning 24 February offensive, says Ukraine2 FebruaryView commentsTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

This small city in Eastern Ukraine is at the centre of an epic battle.For more than six months Russian forces have tried to claim it. Ukrainian troops have resisted, giving rise to the popular slogan here ""Bakhmut holds."" Now the Russians are attacking from three sides, with regular troops and fighters from the notorious Wagner mercenary group. The Russians have reached one of the main highways into the city, and are closing in on the outskirts.There is house-to-house fighting in some areas on the outskirts, with ""hard battles for every home"" according to the Ukrainian military.It feels like Bakhmut is on borrowed time. If so, Ilya and Oleksii intend to use every second of it.The two Ukrainian National Guardsmen move swiftly and silently across open ground on the frontlines and then plunge into a trench. Their camouflage backpacks contain weapons of war - a drone, a modified hand grenade, and a Velcro strap. The German-made grenade had a tail fin attached, made with a 3D printer, to ensure it exploded on impact.Image caption, Ilya and Oleksii use drones armed with grenades to attack Russian troops a short distance awayIlya - an IT guy turned intelligence officer - makes short work of velcroing the grenade to the drone. Then he launches it towards enemy forces nestled in their trenches, a kilometre and a half away. ""We know there are a lot of Russian soldiers there, walking, living, and sitting,"" said Oleksii, the drone pilot. ""And so, we just give them [a] gift."" ""The aim is not to kill a lot of soldiers but to make them afraid of our sky, to make them watch out every second. It´s psychological pressure.""He shows us a drone´s eye view as he releases the grenade over a frozen expanse. We can see the impact on his screen but can´t tell if they were casualties below. Oleksii says the fighting in Bakhmut is tough, emotionally and physically: ""It´s hard, but we are staying here, and we will protect Bakhmut and the area around it as much as we can.""But Ukraine is counting the cost and there´s speculation it could withdraw to avoid further heavy losses.  In the Kremlin, a clock is ticking - counting down to the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion of its neighbour, on 24 February 2022. President Putin wants a victory before then. Taking Bakhmut would give him one, and bring him closer to his aim of capturing all of the mineral rich Donbas region.To reach Bakhmut you drive along winding back roads. The route we used for previous trips last September is now classed as ""suicidal"" because of constant Russian attacks.The city is now a shell. The thud of incoming and outgoing fire echoes through empty streets. Missiles have punched holes through buildings. Power and water supplies are long gone, along with most of the pre-war population of about 70,000.

Tiny gold earrings glint in her ears, her blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she´s wearing a pink sweater.

""Outside I take Mushka for a walk, but she´s afraid of these booms and constantly comes back. Only in the morning, when it is quiet at dawn, I can take her out.""Yulia sits in the gloom nearby, as Anna lists her friends who have already fled. ""I miss them all,"" she says. ""Arina might be in Poland, Masha in Western Ukraine. Diana went somewhere else. Everyone left.""But Yulia is staying put with her daughter. ""Of course, I am worried,"" she tells me. ""But I think it is more or less safe. At least we have everything here, everything is prepared. We think nowhere in Ukraine is safe and we have no means to go abroad.""Their basement shelter is well stocked with food and water, and they get regular deliveries from the White Angels, a unit of Ukrainian police who provide aid and carry out evacuations. The team leader, Pavlo Dyachenko, lights up when he sees Anna. In the depths of war, they have forged a bond.He has brought Anna a new sleeping bag to keep her warm, but he would rather be getting her and her family out of the line of fire. ""I don´t understand why they are deciding to stay,"" he said. ""Bakhmut is under attack in the evening, in the morning, in the night. It´s very dangerous with bombing and shelling all the time.""Image caption, Anna´s colourful drawings line the walls of the basementMore thuds above ground amplify his point. The shelling usually intensifies as midday approaches - part of the rhythm of warfare in Bakhmut. After exhausting overnight battles, troops on both sides sleep late into the mornings, before getting back to their guns.  We race out of the city and onwards through rolling hills that offer a commanding view of the area. ""These heights are more important for the Russians than Bakhmut itself,"" said a Ukrainian colleague. ""If they can bring their artillery here, they can target bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

""We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.""Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.""Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,"" the 70-year-old leader said. ""We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won´t be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin´s comments but did tell reporters that ""as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond"". Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of World War Two´s Battle of Stalingrad, which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops in a major turning point of the war.Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of the conflict. Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the anniversary, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled. Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33. The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated five million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria. Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia´s invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he says are leading the Kyiv government. And he returned to the theme throughout his speech. ""Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,"" he said. ""Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West.""But he vowed that while it was ""unbelievable but true"" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it. Berlin has agreed to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, prompting the Russian company Fores - a Urals-based energy industry firm - to offer five million roubles (£58,250) to the first Russian soldier to destroy or capture one. Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle.Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city´s streets to watch a military parade. As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia´s invasion. Local media reported that regional Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president. Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take ""revenge"" against the West for aiding Ukraine. ""Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,"" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv. Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was ""increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions"" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy. Later, addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in the US via videolink, Mr Zelensky thanked US President Joe Biden for his support and set Ukrainian forces a goal of defeating the Russian invasion in the next year. ""We must do everything we can together so that next year - on the first Thursday of February - we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil,"" Mr Zelensky said.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz is under increasing international and domestic pressure to supply German-built Leopard 2 tanks or at least approve their delivery by third countries. Poland and Finland have both promised to send their Leopards - but need Germany´s permission to do so. But Berlin is still in talks with the US about its official position. Many expect an announcement to follow a meeting of Ukraine´s Western allies at the American military base of Ramstein in southwestern Germany tomorrow. Reports suggest that Mr Scholz will only give the green light to the Leopards if the US President Joe Biden agrees to supply American Abrams tanks. However, the Pentagon´s top security adviser, Colin Kahl, said late on Thursday that the US wasn´t prepared to meet Kyiv´s demands for the tanks.""The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It´s expensive. It´s hard to train on. It has a jet engine,"" Mr Kahl said.A senior German government source told the BBC that reports of a deadlock between Berlin and Washington over tanks were overstated, but they´re causing concern amongst Ukraine´s Western allies.The provision of Western battle tanks - in sufficient numbers - is widely seen as crucial if Ukraine is to defeat Russia or, at the very least, defend itself against Russian President Vladimir Putin´s anticipated spring offensive. Yet, to date, only Britain has promised to supply them. Other countries, including Germany, France and the US, have sent or pledged to send armoured vehicles as well as air defence systems and other heavy equipment. Meanwhile, Kyiv´s demands for tanks are growing increasingly urgent. German defence minister resigns after blundersBakhmut defenders plea for Western tanksUK to send Challenger 2 tanks to UkraineSo why is Mr Scholz dithering over their delivery? All indications are that he will allow third countries to supply their Leopards - the German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said so a week or so ago. But Mr Scholz has not yet committed. He´s cautious for several reasons. Germany worries - albeit less so than it did in the past - about escalation and how Russia´s Vladimir Putin would react to the supply of offensive weapons. It´s a reasoning which many experts perceive to be unjustified. And the concept of German tanks on Ukrainian soil still resonates uncomfortably in Berlin, where the country´s World War Two history still casts a long shadow. Mr Scholz may have declared a ""Zeitenwende"" (sea-change) in Germany´s stance on defence and military policy following Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he´s still mindful that, less than a year ago, the idea of the German government supplying arms to a conflict would have been unthinkable. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mr Scholz´s response to the Ukraine war has remained broadly popular with the German peopleThe Chancellor has his eye on the domestic opinion polls. As one senior government source put it to me, surveys suggest the public are broadly satisfied with his reaction to Ukraine - unlike his policies and performance in many other areas. A recent survey for the national broadcaster found that 41% of the public thought Germany was supplying the right amount of weapons, 26% thought its support went too far and 25% that Germany wasn´t sending enough. Mr Scholz has promised that Germany will play a greater military role on the world stage, but years of underinvestment have left its armed forces in a parlous state. Even if the Chancellor gives the green light to sending Leopards, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned that renovation and preparation requirements would delay their delivery by months. Mr Scholz doesn´t want to risk the perception that he´s acting alone, hence the desire to co-ordinate with allies and, in particular, the US. And it´s why there´s unlikely to be an announcement ahead of the Ramstein meeting tomorrow. But his position has triggered frustration and condemnation in international political and security circles. They say Germany - still a political heavyweight - must step up to its military responsibilities.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warGermanyOlaf ScholzVladimir PutinUkraineBerlinMore on this story´We need Western tanks - my tank´s as old as me´17 JanuaryArmy chief: Sending Ukraine tanks weakens UK forces16 JanuaryUK to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, PM says15 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Her ex-husband was wrapping their son´s body in a blanket. ""I was hysterical,"" she explains. ""I said: ´Are we just going to drive him home in the boot of the car?´"" ""My ex-husband yelled at me: ´Calm down, we just need to get out of here´.""The divorced couple had bought an old Mercedes and travelled hundreds of kilometres. They were behind enemy lines to retrieve the body of their dead Ukrainian soldier son and now they were ploughing through fields in Russian-occupied territory pockmarked with shell craters. After bringing the car to a halt, Anatoliy, Lyudmyla´s ex-husband, walked over to some burnt-out armoured vehicles.Bodies lay scattered on the ground.Image caption, Maksym had his whole life ahead of him""He tore off the uniform to see if there was a tattoo on the arm,"" Ms Kupriychuk said. ""And it was there. It said: ´Never give up´.""""That was all we could recognise our son by,"" the 40-year-old says, her voice trembling. ""The bodies were lying out in the open for days, in the middle of nowhere. They weren´t just burnt, wild animals had gnawed at them too."" Her son Maksym was just 20 years old. He died on the second day of the Russian invasion - 25 February 2022. Dangerous journeyNobody had paid much attention to a middle-aged couple arriving in the Russian-held village of Tomaryne. It´s about a 90-minute drive from the southern city of Kherson. The Russians and their allies were yet to establish their administration, so it was chaotic when the couple arrived there in March 2022.They drove outside the village and met the first manned checkpoint.""I got out of the car and walked towards a man pointing a gun at me,"" Ms Kupriychuk recalls. ""But I wasn´t scared, all I felt was revulsion for these people.""Unbelievably, she says, she managed to cajole the soldiers to let them through. She showed them a photograph of her son´s body and they drove to the field where Maksym died.Then, with his body in the boot, the couple started their 12-hour journey home to Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine. There is no official data on the number of Ukrainian military deaths or missing bodies - that is classified information.As a professional soldier based in Lviv in western Ukraine, Maksym had not told his mother that his air assault force had been sent south to stop the Russian offensive. She was shocked when his girlfriend phoned and announced his death.One of Maksym´s colleagues had a photo of the field where he had been killed and said his body was still there. He told her that Maksym had come under shelling, but there was no other information about the circumstances of his death. Ms Kupriychuk phoned Maksym´s military unit, and they told her to wait for information.""Every night I was going berserk knowing that my son was lying out there in the freezing cold and there was nothing to cover him,"" she says.Days later as dawn broke, Maksym´s parents set off to find him and bring his body home.They had no plan - just the photo, the village name and a contact for a local who had volunteered to guide them.Desperate measuresUkraine´s Presidential Envoy for Servicemen´s Rights, Alyona Verbytska, says 15,000 Ukrainians civilians and military personnel went missing between February and the end of 2022. They could have been killed or captured.On the Russian side, up to 600 soldiers are missing in Ukrainian territory, excluding occupied areas, according to data from the BBC´s Russian service.People are using any means they can to find their loved ones. A famous TV anchor started a countrywide project to help with the search, and Ukrainians have also donated money for equipment such as refrigerated vans to evacuate the bodies of soldiers and return them to their families.In social media groups on Facebook and Telegram, people share information about the missing and ask for help.Natalya Karpova, also from Vinnytsia, was searching for her son, Roman. She found a photo of his body on a Russian Telegram channel in April.Russian military personnel post on these instant messaging channels, and they are often the only source of information from occupied areas.Image caption, Natalya Karpova found a photo of her son´s dead body on TelegramThe post suggested that a sniper had killed the 30-year-old engineer.Friends of Roman called to tell her of his death, saying he´d died at the end of April. That prompted her online search. When she found the photo, she called his air force unit.""They said it was fake and I shouldn´t be relying on the aggressor´s media for information,"" she says.""They said: ´We don´t have any document [saying] that your son has died´.""Shrouded in secrecyUkraine´s military does not comment on missing soldiers as per martial law, which means families often have to wait for the government or volunteers to help return a body.Ms Karpova, a 59-year-old doctor, quit her job to focus on finding Roman´s body herself.She knew he had gone to the frontline, but not which one.The picture posted on Telegram showed his ID and gave an approximate location in eastern Ukraine. With help from another part of the military, a drone was flown over the site, and they located his body near the village of Dovhenke, outside Izyum city in eastern Ukraine.But heavy fighting and the Russian occupation kept it off limits.Inside the recaptured city of IzyumEventually, there was a breakthrough. Ukraine liberated the village in September 2022.""It was autumn, I knew we had no time to waste,"" she says. ""When winter comes and snow falls, there would be nothing left of the body.""Image caption, Roman´s body remained in a field for months before it could be retrievedShe quickly assembled a search team with help from local politicians and activists, as well as the military. Under thick vegetation, and in an area full of landmines, they found Roman´s body, using his military dog tag to identify him.""I felt a load fall off my shoulders,"" his mother says, her voice breaking. ""You cannot imagine what it feels like to be unable to take your son´s body home and bury him.""His body was buried back in his home city of Vinnytsia.The air force told the BBC that heavy fighting and Russia´s occupation meant Roman´s unit was unaware of all the deaths at the time.Lost in mourningOn returning to Vinnytsia, Ms Kupriychuk took Maksym´s body straight to the morgue.""All they let me see was my son´s hand,"" she says. ""They didn´t let me see his body as his head was gone.""Image caption, Lyudmyla Kupriychuk holds Maksym´s military uniformShe has turned Maksym´s bedroom into a shrine. It´s full of photos of him smiling as well as a bottle of his cologne and some handcrafts he made for her as a schoolboy. She takes his uniform from the wardrobe and pulls it close to her, as if hugging him.""Nothing has changed here since he died,"" she says.For Ms Karpova, the fact she found and buried her son has brought no peace.""My husband and I can´t believe he´s dead,"" she says.Ms Karpova adds that she got no support from the air force to find him, though a general later thanked her for finding Roman´s body.""I want victory now so no other mother finds herself in my situation,"" she says.The BBC was unable to reach Maksym´s military unit for comment on the circumstances of his death.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyWeapons now a part of everyday family life26 February 2022The Ukrainian mother who had to bury her own son4 April 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

""When it comes to Ukrainian plans on operations, clearly that is their decision,"" Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters. ""This gives them a longer-range capability, long-range fires capability, that will enable them, again, to conduct operations in defence of their country and take back their sovereign territory, Russian-occupied areas.""Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and considers it part of its territory. But it has come under sporadic fire from Ukrainian forces in recent months. Western nations have repeatedly ruled out providing Ukraine with offensive weapons - such as fighter jets - which it could use to strike against Russia itself. In a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US and President Joe Biden for the additional aid. ""The more long-range our weapons are and the more mobile our troops are, the sooner Russia´s brutal aggression will end,"" Mr Zelensky wrote. ""Together with [the US] we stand against terror."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, President Zelensky has long urged the West to provide his forces with artillery capable of firing over greater distances.Previously, Ukraine´s longest range weapon was the Himars rocket system, which can hit targets at a range of up to 80km (50 miles). Kyiv used the system to devastating effect during its counter-offensive in the south and east last year. The GLSDB also gives Ukraine forces an ability to strike anywhere in the Russian-occupied Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also allows Ukraine to threaten Russian supply lines in the east. Manufactured by Boeing and Saab, GLSDB is a gliding rocket with a small bomb attached, capable of striking a target within one metre of its position. And it can be fired from a variety of weapons systems, including the Himars and M270 MLRS systems already in use in Ukraine. However, both the Pentagon and Boeing refused to comment on delivery dates for the system, with some reports suggesting that it could take up to nine months before it reaches Ukraine. The new package - which will also include additional Himars missiles and 250 Javelin anti-armour systems - comes amid mounting concerns that Western nations have been too slow to provide fresh military aid to Ukraine. ""GLSDB should have been approved last fall, US House of Representatives Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers said in a tweet. ""Every day it´s not approved is a day it´s delayed getting it into the hands of a Ukrainian ready to kill a Russian.""In recent days, reports have emerged that a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region has been gaining momentum, with pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that the town of Bakhmut, long a focal point of Russian attacks, has been surrounded from three-sides. But President Zelensky said his forces were entrenched around the town and would not surrender it to Russian assaults. ""We consider Backhmut to be our fortress,"" the Ukrainian leader said. ""If weapon [deliveries] are accelerated - namely long-range weapons - we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014.""Mr Zelensky said earlier that a long-rumoured Russian spring offensive in the region had already begun and his Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said earlier this week that Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the renewed assault. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leader has been holding new EU accession talks with the bloc´s leaders, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, in Kyiv. Speaking after the summit, Mr Zelensky said the leaders had reached an ""understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine´s membership in the European Union this year"". But Ms von der Leyen said there were ""no rigid timelines"" in place and emphasised that Ukraine had political goals it must meet before joining the block. The EU has repeatedly underlined the need for Ukraine to step up its fight against endemic corruption, reform its judiciary by weeding out political interference and strengthen its economy.Elsewhere, Germany has announced plans to send Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine. The earlier model of the Leopard 2s - which Berlin has already promised to provide - can be delivered to Kyiv sooner than the advanced model.

Asked on Monday if the US would be sending the planes, Mr Biden said ""no"". The UK also said it was ""not practical"" for it to send its aircraft to Ukraine.France´s Emmanuel Macron said ""by definition, nothing is excluded"" ahead of meeting a Ukrainian minister.Ukraine says advanced jets will help protect its skies from Russian attacks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country´s top military officials say there should be no taboos on such military aid - but the US and its partners fear this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia. On Tuesday, Ukraine´s Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat was quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda news website as saying that Kyiv needed up to 200 multi-role fighter jets - such as F-16s - to defend its skies. He said that Russia currently outnumbered Ukraine by five to six times in terms of the number of war planes.The US-made F-16s would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets - mostly MiGs - Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991.However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine´s pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.Other Western allies have been been less definitive though. On Monday, President Macron did not rule out sending its war planes to Ukraine - but he stressed that it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France´s ability to defend itself. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is now in Paris, where he is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Macron and French military officials later on Tuesday.Poland - another key ally of Ukraine - has also not ruled out sending F-16s to Kyiv. However, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any such move would only be possible ""in complete co-ordination"" with other Nato members.The US announced last week it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, reversing its earlier stance on the issue. The UK and Germany also pledged similar support.What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak´s spokesman said he was not aware of any formal request from Ukraine for aircraft, adding that ""the UK´s Typhoon and F-35 jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly"". ""Given that we believe it is not practical to send those jets to Ukraine.""However, the spokesperson said Mr Sunak ""has had intensive discussions with military advisers"" and ""the conclusion is that given Russia´s advantage in numbers a sustained war of attrition would not benefit Ukraine"".Germany has also said it will not send fighter jets to Ukraine. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world´s most reliable fighter jets and is used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), according to the US Air Force. The F-16´s targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy.Moscow has repeatedly accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy, warning that further escalation could trigger a nuclear war.Additional reporting by Thomas SpencerYou might also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decisionRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyGermanyOlaf ScholzRussiaEmmanuel MacronUnited StatesUkraineJoe BidenMore on this storyGermany rules out sending fighter jets to Ukraine29 JanuaryMissiles hit Ukraine after West´s offer of tanks26 JanuaryZelensky urges speedy delivery of Western tanks26 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The BBC´s Imran Qureshi finds out how the Ukraine war shaped their journey.A year ago, Chandra Mohan, an Indian living in Poland, found himself in a crisis when he was saddled with 20,000 kg (44,092 lb) of rice flakes that a business client didn´t want to pick it up.The rice flakes, supplied by a firm based in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were being imported by a local businessman to make cereals. The war in Ukraine had just begun. Four days before the ship carrying the consignment was due at the port in Poland, Mr Mohan´s client got cold feet as the exchange rate fluctuated.Can India get a taste for craft beer?The client wanted the Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce, where Chandra Mohan was head of business relations, to come up with a solution to use the shipment he could no longer afford. Mr Mohan bought the flakes and along with his designer friend Sargheve Sukumaran hit up on an idea of making a beer.""Chandran said, ´I am thinking of a beer called Malayali,´"" Mr Sukumaran recounts.  Both men hail from the southern Indian state of Kerala, whose natives are called Malayalis after their mother tongue, Malayalam. ""I was also interested in creating a product that was rooted in our history - in Kerala and Indian traditions - but appealed to a global audience,"" Mr Sukumaran says. Image source, Chandra MohanImage caption, The company says it has sold over 50,000 bottles of beer so farBoth men were clear that the beer needed to use the rice flakes but should not be ""a rice-y beer"".  The idea wasn´t entirely new.""There is already Japanese beer that is made of rice with Japanese hops,"" Mr Mohan says. The idea was to distinguish their product by having rice flavour beer with European hops.Mr Mohan and Mr Sukumaran turned to another Malayali for advice. Lijo Phillip had launched his own beer brand - Kalikut 1498 - in Poland before the pandemic. Kalikut is another way of spelling Calicut (now called Kozhikode) - a district in Kerala. The return of the Indian Pale AleWith his guidance, Mr Mohan and Mr Sukumaran worked on producing their own beer.  ""In Poland, you have a lot of beers coming in from other European countries, particularly the good ones from Belgium,"" Mr Sukumaran says.  But none of these used rice.Mr Mohan is a teetotaller, so Mr Sukumaran took on the task of tasting and testing products. ""We tried a few times and succeeded on our third try in getting the perfect balance,"" he says.  This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Bira 91 has become a popular beer brand across IndiaThe challenge was now to produce the beer on a large scale. They two got into an arrangement with a brewery which insisted on taking a boiler on rent with a minimum order. This meant they had to get restaurants on board to serve their beer. But they decided on a name for the drink.Mr Mohan had been also leading a team of expats which was helping Indians who had fled Ukraine after the war. ""Most of the volunteers were from Kerala,"" he says. ""And I realised that being Malayali was an emotion [that connected us]."" Mahua: The Indian liquor the British bannedIt inspired the partners to name their drink ´Malayali beer´.  The cultural identity also infused their design of the brand. Mr Sukumaran designed the label around the headgear worn by artists who perform Kathakali - a traditional dance form from Kerala. He then combined this with the state´s love for films by using aviator sunglasses and the moustache of acting legend Mohanlal.  To sustain the business, the two offered a made-to-order bottling service for wedding planners. It was a hit, particularly among Indian immigrants marrying Polish citizens.Now, Malayali Spirits - the company set up by him and Mr Sukumaran - has a contract with a distributor for Indian and Asian grocery stores to supply 2,400 litres (5,074 pints) of beer every two months. The company claims it has sold over 50,000 bottles of beer so far and plans to increase production soon.

""Here, and here, and here,"" he says, as he shows where shrapnel from a Russian missile punctured the transformer´s thick sides. Sharp metal fragments of the missile lie on the ground nearby. Along the way, other transformers as big as bungalows are disappearing behind protective cocoons of concrete and sandbags.Above us loom the high, forbidding, Soviet-era walls of the power plant´s vast turbine hall. Panes of glass for half a mile shattered by explosions from the 12 missiles that have landed here since mid-October.For all the well-publicised damage, the authorities don´t want us to reveal too much.Since October, when temperatures began to plummet, Russia has been using strikes on Ukraine´s power grid to force the civilian population into submission. For two weeks, the BBC watched engineers and technicians who run the network racing to repair the damage and keep electricity flowing across the country.We have been asked not to reveal the precise location of some of the facilities we visit. We´ve also altered the names of some of the officials we meet.""Every time the equipment is damaged, it gets us all right here in our soul,"" Michael says, tapping his chest.Some of these huge rust-stained machines are older than the men who run them. But for Michael, the plant´s manager, they´re his babies.""It´s our life. Our second family.""Image caption, Inside the power plantMichael sent his first family - his wife and teenage son - to Europe early in the war. Their dog, a playful golden retriever, now accompanies him to work every day. The transformer - 130 tonnes of twisted metal, dangling wires and scorch marks where cooling oil leaked and caught fire - is not easy to replace.""I know how much effort it takes to build this, to install and launch it,"" says Michael, a veteran of 30 years in this industry. ""It´s not something you can buy in a store.""The same goes for the turbines inside - monstrous, deafening mechanical dinosaurs, churning and hissing away at the heart of the plant. They´re hugely impressive machines, but there´s little time to admire them, as the air raid siren sounds for the third time this morning. In a well-practised drill, most of the plant´s staff head for the bunkers. The atmosphere is relaxed - such interruptions are commonplace - until word starts to spread of a fresh wave of Russian attacks on the power grid. A sister plant in the west has been hit. A picture circulates of fire raging in a turbine hall much like the one we were in just now.Image caption, A fire rages inside a turbine hallThen, even through the thick concrete walls of our underground retreat, we hear a distant explosion. There´s tension in the room as the men and women check their phones. A crowded apartment block, not far away, has been hit.The scene, when we arrive soon after dark, is chaotic and desperate. A missile has torn a gaping hole in the middle of the nine-storey building. Thick smoke, pierced by flashlights, rises from a pile of rubble. Dozens of rescue workers and volunteers are working frantically to find survivors. The death toll, which mounts inexorably over the coming days, is one of the highest of the war so far. Mothers, fathers, children. Whole families.At the power station, the following morning, the mood is bleak. Everyone believes the missile was aimed at them. ""We need to stop the attacks,"" Michael says. ""We need to close the sky over Ukraine.""Until that happens, Ukraine´s entire grid will be in jeopardy. Especially substations, which have borne the brunt of Moscow´s wrath. These vital hubs, where transformers turn high voltage electricity from power plants into lower mains voltage that businesses and homes can use, have been targeted over and over again. Each hit deprives hundreds of thousands of households of electricity, forcing the state energy company, Ukrenergo, to find ways of diverting power along alternative routes. The firm agrees to give us rare access to a substation, on condition that we do not reveal its location. On the day we visit, a frigid wind whistles across hundreds of miles of open farmland and a watery winter sun pokes through the clouds. The sprawling facility, with its maze of pylons, cables and imposing machinery, feels remote and impersonal, but around 15 million Ukrainians depend on it for power.It´s been hit six times with missiles and drones. The manager, Serhiy, who´s worked here for decades, surveys his shattered empire. Two of the devastated transformers are among the largest in the world, weighing more than 300 tonnes. The specialised steel innards of one of them have been torn out and lie folded on the ground, like the leaves of a clumsily discarded book.Image caption, Equipment damaged by Russian attacksData collected by Kyiv´s Energy Industry Research Centre (EIRC) suggests that about100 substation transformers, of various sizes, have been hit since October. Due to their cost and the many months it takes to manufacture them, not a single one has yet been replacedSerhiy points out the gaping hole in the administration building, where a bookcase and dangling light bulb are pretty much all that´s left of his office. He watched the destruction from 500m away, as a ""kamikaze"" drone tore into the building, wrecking the control room and taking the substation offline.""We knew it would happen sooner or later,"" he says.Repairing the damage will take years.""They know perfectly well why this facility is important for Ukraine. That´s why they decided to destroy it.""You must feel angry all the time, I suggest. Serhiy is a man of few words.""Hate,"" he replies simply. ""Hate towards those who came to kill my people.""With Western help and several months of experience, Ukraine is getting much better at defending itself. Most of the drones fired by Russia are now shot down before reaching their targets, and most of the missiles too. Data from EIRC shows fewer than 10% of the 1,400 missiles and drones fired at Ukraine´s civilian infrastructure since early October have actually destroyed key components of the grid.But it´s still a scramble for the country´s engineers to keep up. Following reports of overnight shelling near the southern city of Nikopol, we join a repair team from DTEK, the country´s largest private energy company, in the middle of a field, overlooking the Dnipro River. The sound of artillery booms across the wide, silver expanse of water. The battle lines aren´t far from here.The damage looks slight. A couple of shallow craters in the field and a few low voltage lines draped across Ukraine´s famously dark soil.But the nearby village of Vyschetarasivka is without power, yet again. The men, some wearing flak jackets, get to work, scaling the poles and twisting wires together. After the colossal scale of the power plant and substation, today´s work feels almost delicate.""This is pure terror,"" says chief engineer Volodymyr. ""Just terrorising the population, causing maximum damage to the energy infrastructure.""Volodymyr would much prefer to keep busy modernising and improving Ukraine´s electricity network. But he´ll keep the repairs going just as long as the Russians keep firing.""We feel a bit hopeless, not being able to influence the situation,"" he says. ""But if necessary, we´ll come back and repair the lines every day. The people need light.""In the village, half emptied by almost a year of war, the power cuts have become more frequent and less predictable. ""Electricity affects pumps and boilers,"" says Bohdan, as he arrives with empty bottles to collect water. ""If there´s no power, people freeze. And we have to buy water from the store. If you have a generator and petrol, you can survive. Otherwise, I don´t know how older people do it.""The mayor, Oleksandr Sivak, wrapped up against the biting east wind, says those who can´t stand it have already left. ""As long as we´re alive and have even a bit of electricity and water, we´ll keep on living,"" he says.The sound of artillery is getting closer, forcing Oleksandr to drop to his knees. It´s a sensible precaution, the result of long months of constant danger.Downriver, beyond Nikopol, a town shelled day and night from Russian positions to the south, we meet another team repairing power lines, reconnecting communities under Russian occupation until the autumn. Here, amid the debris of recent conflict - a rocket lodged in the pavement, shattered headstones in a cemetery and a score of recently dug graves - the DTEK team must proceed with caution.The use of anti-personnel mines along former front lines adds another element of hazard. Up ahead, State Emergency Service personnel are walking slowly along a line of pylons, inspecting the undulating ground for discarded ordnance.""We feel like semi-soldiers,"" says team leader Fyodor, another grizzled veteran of the industry, as he pauses for a cigarette.Above him, colleagues in a cherry picker are hard at work, hauling a new high voltage line up to a pylon.""Sometimes we go on trips to restore power in an area. Then they shell us and we have to go back. It´s a race.""For all the hardship we observe during two weeks on the road in Ukraine, it´s a race the engineers seem to be winning. People grumble, for sure, when the lights go out, their apartments grow cold and the water stops flowing. Hospitals have reported higher numbers of road traffic accidents as motorists move around darkened city roads.But away from the front lines, people have adjusted to the lack of electricity much as they have to the air raid sirens and occasional explosions: with pragmatism and ingenuity. Image caption, Fyodor and his teamOn city streets, in the middle of a blackout, portable generators churn away on pavements and down alleyways. In Kyiv, for all the midwinter gloom, shops are open, restaurants full. Walk into any motorway service station and the same scene greets you every time: brightly lit, well-stocked shelves, muzak playing and the hand-driers in immaculate toilets blasting out hot air. You could be forgiven for thinking you were anywhere else in Europe. And that´s the way those in charge of Ukraine´s energy grid would like it. ""It was our aim for many years, to integrate into the European grid,"" says Oleksandr Kharchenko, EIRC´s director. ""And now it´s happened.""Russia´s energy war, just like its military campaign, is having the exact opposite of its desired effect. Far from separating Ukraine from Europe, it´s binding it ever closer, in a process that mirrors the country´s gradual integration into the Western military alliance, Nato.Ukraine officially declared its desire to join the European grid in 2017. It´s typically a lengthy process - it took Turkey 11 years - but when Vladimir Putin decided to invade last year, the process accelerated dramatically. In February last year Ukraine disconnected itself from the Russian grid for the first time, to test the country´s ability to manage in ""isolated mode"" during the winter months, when demand for electricity peaks. The disconnect, the first of two, was due to take place on the 18th and last just three days. The Russians requested a delay. It eventually happened at 01:00 on 24 February. ""We disconnected four hours before the invasion started, from this very building,"" Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, told me at his Kyiv headquarters.""When the invasion started, it became obvious we would not reconnect.""Was the invasion timed to coincide with Ukraine´s moment of maximum isolation? ""I absolutely believe the war started on the 24th just because of this,"" Kharchenko says.Infrastructure was targeted in the early days, but not enough to plunge the country into chaos.""They thought we would have a national blackout,"" Kharchenko says. ""That this would cause panic, no connection, no government, no-one knows where the president is, how to connect with your siblings, your parents.""None of this happened.Amid mounting speculation about Moscow´s intentions in the weeks before 24 February, the company had quietly moved the grid´s main control room to an undisclosed location further west. A second experimental disconnect was scheduled for June, when demand is typically low. If everything went according to plan, Ukraine would finally join the European grid in October 2023. But with industry shutting down and millions of Ukrainians fleeing the country, electricity consumption plummeted by 40% within three days of the invasion. Ukrenergo asked its European partners if it could bring forward the second test.""They looked at us like we were crazy,"" Kharchenko, who advises Ukrenergo, recalls.But by 16 March, it was all done. With Russian troops still menacing the capital, Ukraine connected to the European grid, a year-and-a-half ahead of schedule. For a few months, Ukraine was even able to export its excess electricity. That all stopped in October. Since then, the country has had to make do with half the electricity it had before 24 February.But it hasn´t collapsed.""I think the reason is the same why they cannot win on the battlefield,"" Kudrytskyi says. ""Because we were prepared and we were resolved to win this particular battle.""Ukraine has fought many battles over the past year.Image caption, Ukrainian flags fly across a cemeteryIn a sprawling, hilltop cemetery on the edge of the eastern city of Dnipro, hundreds of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags flap noisily in the stiff breeze. Rows of freshly dug graves await the latest casualties from the front, 100 miles to the east. Each cross, unmarked grave and rippling flag drives home the desperate cost of this war.But overhead, rising against a fiery sunset, pylons march away across the landscape. Ukraine is still connected.

The attack would also mark Russia´s Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army. Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk.Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said. The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage.""The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. ""By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.""Ukraine has recently renewed calls for fighter jets to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks. Image source, AFPImage caption, At least three people are thought to have been killed in a Russian rocket attack on the eastern city of KramatorskMr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive.In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilisation of some 300,000 conscripted troops, which he said was necessary to ensure the country´s ""territorial integrity"". But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher. ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides.Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was ""operationally surrounded"".The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to ""undertake a decisive action"" and launch a ""big offensive"" in the east. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine´s commanders would seek to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive"" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"" he said, adding that Ukraine´s forces ""cannot lose the initiative"" they have achieved in recent months. The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"". Mr Reznikov´s comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.""Meanwhile, Ukraine´s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. She added that Moscow´s troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"" she said. Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. ""There is a certain increase in the occupiers´ offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. ""The situation is becoming even more severe.""While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia´s recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has told Reuters that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group. Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn´t want to fight being shot. About 80% of Wagner´s personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyBillionaire targeted in Ukraine´s corruption swoop1 February´Russia is learning - we need to learn faster´1 FebruaryUkraine deserves to join Nato, says new Czech leader1 FebruaryView commentsTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The Kherson regional administration said the region was shelled almost 40 times on Saturday and was pounded continually on Sunday. Kherson was the only regional capital to have fallen to Russian forces since the February 2022 invasion, but they were forced into a humiliating retreat in November. President Zelensky said Russia had also stepped up its attacks in the eastern Donetsk region. He said his forces needed new weapons to confront a ""very tough"" situation of constant attacks.""Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon.

Of the 50,000 people who lived in the city before the war, only 2,000 remainBy Laura GozziBBC NewsRussian soldiers are dying in greater numbers in Ukraine this month than at any time since the first week of the invasion, according to Ukrainian data.The Ukrainian data shows 824 Russian soldiers dying per day in February. The figures were highlighted by the UK´s Ministry of Defence. The figures cannot be verified - but the UK says the trends are ""likely accurate"".The increase comes as Ukrainian officials say that Russia has launched a ""big offensive"".However, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC), Oleksiy Danilov, also said Russia is experiencing ""big problems"" with the campaign. ""Our troops are repulsing [the offensive] very strongly,"" Mr Danilov said. ""The offensive they planned is already taking place, gradually, but it´s not the offensive they imagined.""Last week, Ukraine´s outgoing defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said they were anticipating a new Russian offensive around 24 February - the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. Some of the fiercest fighting has been around Bakhmut in the east of the country.On Sunday, the head of Russia´s Wagner mercenary force said the group had seized a settlement near the devastated city.Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Telegram: ""Today, the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by assault detachments of the Wagner PMC."" What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Mr Prigozhin also gave his group credit for the offensive on Bakhmut, downplaying the Russian army´s role: ""Within a radius of 50 km, plus or minus, there are only Wagner PMC fighters,"" he wrote. The statement hints at longstanding tensions between the Russian military and Wagner. When the town of Soledar was taken in January, Mr Prigozhin claimed his fighters were in full control there and boasted that only his troops took part - a claim the Russian defence ministry questioned.Bakhmut´s strategic importance has been questioned, but the prolonged fighting has turned it into a symbolic prize.According to the Ukrainian data, highlighted by the UK, 824 Russian losses a day is more than four times the rate reported in June and July, when around 172 Russian soldiers died each day. The Ukrainian military claims 137,780 Russian military deaths since the full-scale invasion began.The UK´s MoD pointed out the recent increase could be due to ""a range of factors, including lack of trained personnel, coordination, and resources across the front"". Ukraine ""also continues to suffer a high attrition rate"", the UK said.Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia´s expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that would enable Ukraine to double its attack range.But President Zelensky wants the West to send fighter jets - saying during a visit to the UK Parliament this week that he was ""thanking you all in advance for powerful English planes"".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyUkraine braced for new Russian offensive this month6 FebruaryRussians seen reinforcing east ahead of offensive7 FebruaryBorrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in8 FebruaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But the soldiers also insisted that morale remains high, despite growing exhaustion after almost a year of war.The two Ukrainian soldiers swept into the room, still visibly flushed with adrenalin, having just driven straight from the furiously active front lines along the rolling, snow-covered hills further south. Peering over a giant map at their brigade´s temporary headquarters, they jabbed at the spots where Russian forces were inching forwards towards a key road.""They were about 400 metres [437 yards] from us, across the field just here. We´re holding on, but it´s getting harder,"" said Sgt Denys Kalchuk from the all-volunteer Dnipro-1 Battalion, going on to describe how Russian infantry, fighter jets and artillery units appeared to be operating with growing co-ordination and effectiveness around Bakhmut. ""The planes are the worst. You can´t hear them until it´s too late. It´s the same with the tanks. Artillery is easier - at least you might have a second or two [to dive for cover] after you hear them coming,"" said Sgt Kalchuk.Assessing the overall state of the conflict across the Donbas is extremely difficult. Access is challenging and dangerous, and dozens of different Ukrainian battalions and brigades are working on separate tasks, amid some secrecy, spread out along hundreds of miles of often fast-changing front lines. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ukrainian troops say Russian forces are operating with growing co-ordination and effectiveness around BakhmutBut after several weeks travelling across the region, and more than a dozen on-the-record interviews and frank off-the-record discussions with a broad range of Ukrainian soldiers, I have seen various themes emerging.For weeks, Russia´s notorious mercenary group Wagner has led much of the fighting around Bakhmut, sustaining catastrophic numbers of casualties by launching near-suicidal mass infantry attacks on smaller towns like Soledar. But in recent days, according to some Ukrainian soldiers, Russia´s regular army has resumed a more prominent role, with noticeable effect.""It is very hard for us now. We understand that Russia is learning every day and changing their strategy. And I think we need to learn faster,"" said Dmytro Podvorchanskyi, who heads a reconnaissance unit in Dnipro-1. He and others spoke of the way well-equipped regular Russian forces were now hiding and dispersing their ammunition stores far better and targeting Ukrainian logistics routes more effectively. As a result, they are continuing to gain ground around Bakhmut and threatening another potentially significant town, Vuhledar, further south.Image caption, Dmytro Podvorchanskyi says Ukrainian troops need to learn fasterBut there is no indication, as yet, that Russian forces are poised to make a strategically significant breakthrough. One senior commander said Western supplies had now brought a balance to what had been a deeply uneven artillery war, and that Western tanks could soon tip the overall balance in Ukraine´s favour. While it is no surprise that many Ukrainian troops are suffering from exhaustion after months of conflict, morale, in general, appears to be holding.""There have been cases of [Ukrainian] units who don´t seem willing to fight, and disagreements [over tactics],"" one Ukrainian soldier acknowledged, speaking off the record. Others talked about the trauma of seeing their friends die, of units that had sustained overwhelming numbers of casualties and of the psychological impact of fighting amidst the corpses of so many uncollected Russian soldiers. One soldier, citing fears of a new Russian mobilisation and the huge size of the enemy´s population, spoke of his fear that ""Russia will grind us down"". But most troops we met waved away such doubts, blaming them on exhaustion and - in general - praising their commanders for giving them time to rest.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Russia has devastated the Donbas region with bombing and shellingOne increasingly common excuse offered for Ukraine´s struggles around Bakhmut is the theory that relatively weak and inexperienced units are now being left to hold the line here, while the army´s strongest forces are being moved elsewhere ahead of a widely anticipated Ukrainian counterattack, or counterattacks.The location of any such potential offensives remains the subject of much speculation among Ukrainian troops. Some anticipate a push further north, into Luhansk province, while others wonder about an attack south towards Melitopol, in order to isolate and threaten Russian forces in and around the Crimean peninsula. One experienced officer said he believed Russia was looking to straighten its frontline, take a few more chunks of the Donbas, and then declare ""mission accomplished"" and push for peace negotiations. He said he was sure Ukraine would never agree to that but warned that the military would need Western fighter jets to break through all of Russia´s new defences, particularly in the south of the country.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyFive ways Ukraine war could go in 202327 December 2022Funeral held for battleground body collector in Ukraine30 JanuaryWhy Germany delayed sending tanks to Ukraine25 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Then, as the back door opened and a wooden coffin was pulled out, the sobbing began.""My son! Why?"" cried Ludmilla Sosnenko, clutching her daughter for comfort.There have been many untimely, unexpected funerals in this northern Donbas town in recent months, but this one, unusually, was not for a soldier or a regular civilian. Denys Sosnenko - a 21-year-old former Ukrainian national kickboxing champion - volunteered last year to work as a body collector for a charitable organisation known as Black Tulip, who scour the frontlines for the abandoned corpses of soldiers, both Ukrainian and Russian.""Denys - there are many angels on your shoulders today - the angels of those you brought back home,"" said Alexey Yukov, the local head of Black Tulip, addressing the crowd. ""Because of your work so many soldiers, who died in places no one would ever have looked, have been reunited with their families.""Image source, BBC/Ed HabershonImage caption, Among those at the funeral were Deny´s father Eduard (left), mother Ludmilla (right) and his sister Natalia (centre)Sosnenko died last week when the van he was driving - a van very much like the one that carried his body into the town square - hit an anti-tank mine close to the frontlines. ""He always said ´this is my mission - I have to do this´. It was dangerous work, but he would reassure us, saying ´don´t worry, we are protecting the souls of the dead,´"" his mother Ludmilla said. ""He was always cheerful and had big plans for life after the war.""Last year, the BBC filmed Sosnenko and his team at work more than once. The body collectors of UkraineHe spoke of the horrors of the job, picking bodies up, piece by piece, and of the constant dangers - not just from the war raging around them, but from boobytraps often hidden beneath corpses, allegedly by retreating Russian troops. The team often use drones and other equipment to search for explosive devices.Image source, BBC/Ed HabershonImage caption, In an interview with the BBC, Denys Sosnenko had spoken about the dangers of his jobBut Sosnenko and his colleagues also talked passionately about the importance of their work. Many of the bodies they´ve collected over the past 11 months have been those of Russian soldiers which have then been exchanged, across the frontlines, for the bodies of missing Ukrainian servicemen.""We feel a sense of grace in doing this, in bringing people home to their families,"" Artur Semeyko - who worked alongside Sosnenko - said, recalling the peace they had brought to people who had previously been unable to arrange a proper funeral for their missing relatives.Image source, BBC/Ed HabershonImage caption, Sosnenko´s colleagues insist they will continue their work ""even if it costs us our lives""Speaking after Sosnenko´s funeral, in a snow-bound cemetery on the edge of Slovyansk, Mr Semeyko insisted that nothing had changed.""We are glad we were able to bury him with honour,"" said Mr Semeyko. ""He accomplished so much in such a short life, but now we must continue our work to bring more people home.""""We will return to work as soon as possible,"" agreed Mr Yukov. ""We will go back, even if it costs us our lives,"" he added. ""We realise that we don´t have time to mourn, because the war goes on and so many lads are dying.

It was certainly a decisive moment, with a coalition of Western nations confirming they were finally willing to supply modern-made main battle tanks. Germany said it would send Leopard 2 tanks and the US said it would send M1 Abrams tanks. Both the UK and Poland have already made concrete pledges, and other nations are expected to follow. Some commentators have described the move as a potential ""gamechanger"". But is it really enough to win the war? Ben Barry, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), tells the BBC that Western tanks will make a difference. But the former British Army Brigadier also warns that the pledges made so far are unlikely to prove decisive. In modern warfare, tanks have been a key element for offensive operations - to punch through enemy lines and retake territory. Used effectively, they provide mobile firepower, protection, shock and surprise. Concentrated in numbers, they can dislocate an enemy´s defences. But they also need the support of artillery to first weaken those defences and then the support of infantry to hold retaken ground.History shows tanks alone don´t win battles. The British first used hundreds of tanks at the battle of Cambrai in November 1917 - to end the deadlock of static trench warfare. Initially they made significant advances, but many tanks soon broke down and a German counter offensive turned British gains into losses.Tanks can also be used in defence. In 1940 they were used by the retreating British and French armies at Arras to stall the Nazi invasion, allowing the subsequent evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk. But Ukraine has made clear that it wants weapons not just to stall any potential Russian spring offensive, but to retake its own territory - to go on the attack.How Ukraine might use tanks as attack spearheadsIt would make little sense for Ukraine to disperse its additional tanks across a frontline of more than 1,000km (621 miles). To break through Russian defences, Ukraine will need to concentrate its forces - possibly over an area of between five and 20km (between three and 12 miles). Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former colonel in the British Army´s Royal Tank Regiment, says numbers do matter for a breakthrough. An armoured brigade for a significant offensive operation would normally include at least 70 tanks. So more than 100 Western battle tanks could make a big difference, he says.If Ukraine had more it could try to conduct simultaneous offensive operations in different places, as it did last year in the north and the south. Germany confirms it will send tanks to UkraineLeopard 2 tanks: Why Germany delayed sending themgThen there´s the additional support required for what the military call ""combined arms manoeuvre"". The UK is not just sending Ukraine 14 Challenger tanks, but also 30 artillery self-propelled guns and armoured vehicles to carry and protect troops. That new package of military support also includes mine breaching and bridge-laying vehicles. In other words, the essential elements needed for any offensive operation.The US is also providing Ukraine with more than 100 Bradley and Stryker armoured vehicles, and Germany 40 of its Marder infantry fighting vehicle - as well as tanks.Tanks are the tip of the spear, designed to move quickly over open ground. The Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams are faster than most Russian-made tanks with speeds of more than 25mph (40km per hour) on rough terrain. To take ground quickly, with any element of surprise, they would likely avoid urban areas where they would be more vulnerable to attack. Russia showed early on in this war, in its failed attempt to surround Kyiv, that a long column of armour on a road is an easy target. Mr Barry, of ISS, says any spearhead attack would look for an enemy´s weak points. But he also warns that Russia has spent the last few months reinforcing defensive positions with trenches and tank traps. Western tanks are also about 20 tonnes heavier than their Russian counterparts. The additional armour gives better protection but it also means the tanks may be too heavy to cross some makeshift bridges. Russia and Ukraine have both blown bridges to slow down advances.Surprise attacks at nightMr de Bretton Gordon, who commanded a squadron of British Challenger tanks, says one of the big advantages of Western-made tanks is their ability to fight at night.Night sights and thermal imaging camera are standard. Only Russia´s more advanced tanks - like the T-90 - are fitted to fight at night. Attacks under the cover of darkness also add to the element of shock and surprise.The greatest challenge for Ukraine will be logistics - maintaining the flow of fuel, ammunition and spare parts. Ukraine is not just having to maintain its old Soviet-era arsenal, it is also having to worry about an increasingly complex inventory of Western supplied weapons. Ukraine weapons: what equipment is the world giving?Britain´s Challenger 2 tanks, for instance, do not use the same Nato standard ammunition as the Leopard and Abrams. The Challenger 2 is no longer in production and even the British Army has had to cannibalise some spare parts from its existing fleet. Mr Barry says Ukrainian engineers may be familiar with repairing diesel engines - like those in the Leopard and Challenger. But he says the US-made Abrams runs on a more complicated gas turbine engine. It also consumes about twice the amount of fuel as a German-made Leopard. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Germany produces the vast majority of modern heavy tanks in Europe - the Leopard 2sIf Western pledges are firmed, Ukraine´s armed forces could be boosted by more than 100 tanks. That would still fall well short of what Ukraine´s overall military commander asked for. Last October, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine needed an additional 300 tanks, 700 infantry fighting vehicles and 500 howitzers for his planned offensive this year. It might end up with just half of that. The training required on the weapons will take time too - weeks if not months. And it´s still not clear when all this equipment will arrive. The US has indicated that its 31 M1 Abrams tanks might not be ready for months. Ukraine is also waiting for the West to respond to its repeated request for modern warplanes. An army attacking on the ground will need protection from the air. Western officials had hoped that Ukraine may be able to mount an offensive as soon as this spring. They believe there is now a window of opportunity while Russia struggles to recruit and rebuild its battered forces, and to replenish its dwindling supplies of ammunition. Ukraine has managed to prove the doubters wrong in the past - but it will still need more Western support if it is to achieve its goal of expelling Russian forces.

It is the latest European country to say it is increasing military spending as a result of the conflict.Poland has a military budget of just less than 2.5% of its GDP, but the prime minister says he wants to increase the figure to 4% this year. Last week, Mateusz Morawiecki urged Germany to allow his country to export Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.""The war in Ukraine makes us arm ourselves even faster. That is why this year we will make an unprecedented effort: 4% of GDP for the Polish army,"" Mr Morawiecki said.Raising defence spending to 4% ""might mean that this will be the highest percentage... among all Nato countries,"" he added.Poland, which borders the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, has previously said it was buying 116 Abrams tanks from the US with the first deliveries to start this spring.Russia´s invasion of Ukraine has led many Western countries to review their military spending - and in many cases, increase it significantly.Members of the Nato Western military alliance have agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP, a measure of a country´s economic output, on defence from 2024. The figure of 2% has been a long-standing target for the alliance.Recently, France outlined plans for a major boost to its armed forces in part due to the war in Ukraine, saying the next seven-year budget would increase to €413bn (£360bn) from 2024-30, up from €295bn.Sweden and Finland have announced steep increases in their military budgets as part of their bid to join Nato. Days after the invasion in February 2022, Germany pledged an extra €100bn of the budget to the armed forces. And in June, the UK promised under former prime minister Boris Johnson to increase spending to 2.5% of GDP.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Poland´s PM last week: ""Free world cannot afford not to send Leopard tanks""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warMilitaryNatoPolandMore on this storyPolish PM urges German bravery on tanks for Ukraine24 JanuaryGermany won´t block tank exports - foreign minister24 JanuaryMacron plans big boost for French defence budget20 JanuaryWestern allies to send fighting vehicles to Ukraine6 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

In a BBC interview Ukraine´s Dmytro Kuleba appealed to all countries willing to send Leopard 2 tanks to ""immediately, officially request the German government to allow delivery of these tanks to Ukraine"". ""This is the move that will make the whole situation crystal clear and we will see where it takes Germany.

We will have it this time as well.""A spokesperson for the German government said it had not yet received any requests to authorise delivery of the Leopard 2 tanks.Last week, Mr Morawiecki said Poland was ready to provide 14 Leopard 2s for Kyiv. On Monday, the Polish president´s foreign policy adviser, Marcin Przydacz, said he welcomed Ms Baerbock´s announcement, but would prefer to hear Germany´s position confirmed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz.""It turns out that through talks and diplomatic actions, Poland is able to change the German position,"" Mr Przydacz told Polish Radio.However, Poland ultimately wants Berlin and Nato allies to also send their own Leopards, because government officials admit that 14 tanks will have a limited impact on Ukraine´s fighting capacity.Meanwhile, Vyacheslav Volodin, Speaker of Russia´s Duma lower house of parliament, warned that the United States and Nato support of Ukraine would risk sparking a ""terrible war"", and supplying weapons that Ukraine could use to ""strike civilian cities and attempt to seize our territories"" would lead to ""retaliatory measures using more powerful weapons"".The Leopard 2 tanks were specifically designed to compete with the Russian T-90 tanks, which are being used in the invasion.There are believed to be more than 2,000 of them worldwide and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said about 300 of them would help ensure a Russian defeat.Many allied countries have become frustrated with Germany over its reluctance to send its own Leopard 2 tanks. Under current regulations, Germany must also sanction any re-export of its tanks by other countries, such as Poland.Following a meeting of more than 50 allied countries on Friday, Germany had not yet committed to supplying the tanks nor releasing their export licence. But it denied unilaterally blocking the tanks´ export.In a joint statement on Saturday the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania told Germany ""to provide Leopard tanks to Ukraine now"". Why are Leopard tanks so in demand?By Chris Partridge, BBC weapons analystThe Leopard 2 tank is a world-class weapon used by more than a dozen countries. Ukraine sees tanks as another vital part of its defence against Russian forces and Leopards have seen combat action in Afghanistan and Syria.What makes them particularly attractive to Kyiv is that nearly two-thirds of all Leopards produced are still in Europe. So physically getting Leopards to the fight is relatively straightforward. That also makes maintenance and repair - vital aspects of any weapons system - easier too.It is worth remembering in all this that Germany is giving Ukraine vital air defence systems, such as IRIS-T and Patriot surface-to-air missiles, as well as armoured personnel carriers.Mr Scholz has traditionally been sceptical of German involvement in military conflicts, and concerned about triggering an escalation from Russia.The chancellor met French president Emmanuel Macron at the weekend to reiterate the two countries´ post-war alliance.France has already committed to sending light tanks to Ukraine, and Mr Macron suggested it was possible that French-made Leclerc heavy tanks may also be delivered to Ukraine. Other countries have committed to sending tanks, including the UK, which will send 14 Challenger 2s.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warOlaf ScholzEmmanuel MacronMore on this storyWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?4 days agoGermany yet to commit to sending tanks to Ukraine20 JanuaryGive us tanks, says Zelensky, as Western allies meet20 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished32 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

He said the UNHCR would try to get access to those affected and try to find solutions in their best interest.However, Mr Grandi admitted he did not know how many children were affected. ""In the situation of war, you cannot determine if children have families or guardianship. And therefore, until that is clarified, you cannot give them another nationality or having them adopted by another family,"" Mr Grandi said.According to the most recent UNHCR data, nearly three million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded in Russia - more than in any other European country. It is unclear how many of these are children. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said earlier this month almost 14,000 children had been ""deported"" to Russia from occupied parts of Ukraine, and accused it of kidnapping them. The Kremlin has denied the allegations.  Mr Grandi has said the UNHCR is seeking access to Russia ""all the time"" but that so far this has been ""rare, sporadic and not unfettered"".His comments come after the United Nations´ top rights official expressed concern in July that Ukrainian children had been taken from orphanages in the eastern Donbas region and ""forcibly deported"" to Russia. There was also concern Moscow was ""modifying existing legislation"" to fast-track this process. Michelle Bachelet said at the time that she could not confirm the allegations or the number of children potentially affected. Then in September, the assistant UN secretary-general for human rights said there were ""credible allegations"" of ""forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation itself"".Mr Grandi was speaking at the end of a six-day visit to Ukraine and told local residents that ""the whole world admires you because you are strong people.""He said it was possible more refugees could return to Ukraine in the summer, as happened last year, but warned that more fighting could lead to greater displacement, especially internally.Mr Grandi also painted a bleak global outlook when it came to refugees - predicting the number of displaced people would ""almost inevitably"" grow from the current figure of around 103 million in the coming years.Related TopicsRussiaRefugees and asylum seekersUkraineUkrainian refugeesMore on this story‘We long for home - but our son has chances here’20 December 2022Ukraine history cancelled for children under occupation31 August 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

It´s led to some politicians in the US calling for aid to Ukraine to be restricted.President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to quickly restore public faith, but the allegations are serious, and the timing is bad.Several claims have surfaced thanks to Mykhaylo Tkach, an investigative journalist for the news website Ukrayinska Pravda.He has recently reported that the company of a senior official´s personal trainer allegedly received millions of pounds since the full-scale invasion, as well as a story about President Zelensky´s deputy head of office.Kyrylo Tymoshenko quit two months after Tkach reported that he´d moved his family to the mansion of a well-known property developer.The journalist also published footage which appeared to show the official driving an expensive Porsche for a few months.Mr Tymoshenko has denied doing anything wrong. ""Quite often, with MPs and officials, if the source of their money isn´t clear, they register assets to people close to them,"" explains Tkach.Image caption, Mykhaylo Tkach is an investigative journalist who has reported on some of the alleged corruption""These are signs of non-transparency, at a time when every step of an official should be clear for society.""The reporter concedes corruption exists in many countries. It´s why he thinks the reaction to it is most important.From her bakery in Vorzel, near Kyiv, Ivanna is less than impressed with her government being accused of agreeing to pay inflated prices to an unknown firm, a deputy minister allegedly accepting a bribe worth £300,000 ($372,000), and an official´s expensive taste in cars.""I don´t like it,"" she says, while her husband Vyacheslav stirs dough in the back room.""It would be better for this money to go towards something good for Ukraine.""She pauses: ""We need to replace all those politicians who´ve been there for many years. They´ve got used to it; it feeds them.""For Ukraine, receiving billions of dollars in military, humanitarian and financial aid brings responsibility and scrutiny.It also increases the likelihood of money ending up in the wrong hands.""We are talking about Ukraine´s existence,"" says Tkach. ""It´s not just some ordinary year for our country. So, I think this wave of resignations, initiated by the president, is an important acknowledgement and necessary action.""Image caption, Ivana wants to replace politicians who have been in power for yearsEver since Ukraine declared independence 31 years ago, corruption has plagued its public services and most of all its politics.In 2014, a popular revolution toppled the last Moscow-leaning government because people wanted to finally live under a democracy.Ever since, Ukraine has attempted a series of reforms, notably driven by Russia´s subsequent campaign of aggression towards the country. Change was seen as essential to securing the West´s continued support.New anti-corruption agencies were then set up, along with new systems for government spending, a new police force, and politicians were forced to disclose their wealth - often with eye-watering confessions.""We wanted results,"" Yaroslav Yurchyshyn tells me. He´s an MP and deputy head of the parliamentary anticorruption committee.""Yes, we have some leftovers from corruption in the past, but at least now we are not silent about it. The next stop will be prevention.""BBCWe have some leftovers from corruption in the past, but at least now we are not silent about itYaroslav YurchyshynUkrainian MPMr Yurchyshyn believes there´s no better time to expose ministerial wrongdoing, even with Western help being put at risk.""Western partners understand we have two wars,"" he says. ""The first is against Russia, then there´s our internal war for the future of Ukraine.""Before the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, Western allies like the European Union and the US weren´t happy with the pace of Kyiv´s efforts to combat corruption.While it´s not clear what the political damage of the 2023 allegations will be for President Zelensky, his response to them this time has been described as ""quick and decisive"" by the US.With more allegations expected to surface, he´ll be hoping other supporters feel the same.Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Siobhan LeahyRelated TopicsUkrainian governmentRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyKyivUkraineUkrainian parliamentMore on this storyTop Ukraine officials quit in corruption crackdown24 JanuaryRussia´s war drains Ukraine´s rich list of power3 JanuaryThe Ukrainians trying to run start-ups in a war7 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

So when Russia said it was calling up 300,000 men to help turn things around in a war it was losing, Kalinin did not want to risk being sent to the front line to kill Ukrainians. But, unlike hundreds of thousands of others, he did not want to leave the country. Three things kept him in Russia: friends, financial constraints and an unease about abandoning what he knows. ""Leaving would have been a difficult step out of my comfort zone,"" Kalinin, who is in his thirties, told the BBC. ""It isn´t exactly comfortable here either but nevertheless, psychologically, it would be really hard to leave.""And so he took the unusual step of saying goodbye to his wife and heading for the forest, where he has lived in a tent for nearly four months. He uses an antenna tied to a tree for internet access and solar panels for energy. He has endured temperatures as low as -11C (12F) and exists on food supplies brought to him regularly by his wife. Living off-grid, he says, is the best way he can think of to avoid being called up. If the authorities can´t hand him a summons in person, he can´t be forced to go to war. ""If they are physically unable to take me by the hands and lead me to the enlistment office, that is a 99% defence against mobilisation or other harassment.""In some ways, Kalinin continues his life as before. He still works eight hours a day in the same job, although throughout winter - with its limited daylight - he doesn´t have enough solar power to work full days and so makes up his hours on the weekend. Some of his colleagues are now in Kazakhstan, having also left Russia after mobilisation began, but his internet connection via a long-range antenna strapped to a pine tree is reliable enough that communication is not a problem. He is also a lover of the outdoors, spending many of his past holidays camping in southern Russia with his wife. When he made the decision to move permanently to the wilderness, he already had much of the equipment he needed. Image source, Adam KalininImage caption, Kalinin says he doesn´t know how much longer he will stay in the forestHis wife, who visited Kalinin´s camp for a couple of days over the new year, plays a big role in his survival. She brings supplies every three weeks to a drop-off point where they are briefly able to see each other in person. He then takes the supplies away to a safe place which he visits every few days to stock up. He cooks using a makeshift wood-burning stove. ""I have oats, buckwheat, tea, coffee, sugar. Not enough fresh fruit and vegetables of course, but it´s not too bad,"" he says. Kalinin´s new home is a large tent of the type used for ice-fishing. When he first arrived in the forest, he set up two camps five minutes apart; one with internet access where he worked, the other in a more sheltered spot where he slept. As winter approached and the weather got colder, he brought the two areas together to live and work under one canvas. Recently, the temperature dropped to -11C, colder than he had expected. But now the days are getting longer again and the snow is beginning to melt, he plans to stay where he is. Although Kalinin hasn´t received a call-up himself, he says the situation is constantly changing and he fears he could receive a summons in the future. Officially, IT workers like Kalinin are exempt from the draft, but there are numerous reports in Russia of similar exemptions being ignored. Hundreds arrested as Russian draft protests continueOne man´s exhausting ordeal to escape conscriptionWhat does Russia´s troop call-up mean for Ukraine?Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilisation on 21 September, shortly after Ukraine´s lightning counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region during which it reclaimed thousands of square kilometres of territory from Russian troops. He said the mobilisation was necessary to defend Russia against the West. But many in the country protested, and there were chaotic scenes on Russia´s borders as hundreds of thousands of people fled.The call-up had a profound effect on Russia. Until then, many Russians were able to continue their lives much as they had before the war. True, some Western brands disappeared and sanctions made financial transactions more difficult, but the direct impact on society was mostly limited. Mobilisation brought the war crashing on to the doorsteps of many Russian families. Suddenly, sons, fathers and brothers were deployed to the front line at short notice, often with poor equipment and minimal training. If the conflict seemed distant before, now it was all but impossible to ignore. Yet, public acts of protests are rare inside Russia - something that has been criticised in Ukraine and in the West. But Kalinin says people are rightly scared of what might happen to them. ""We have a totalitarian state that has become so powerful. In the last six months, laws have been brought in at an incredible pace. If a person speaks out now against the war, the state will pursue them."" Image source, Adam KalininImage caption, An ice-fishing tent is Kalinin´s space for work and sleepKalinin´s life in the forest has brought him a certain level of popularity online, with 17,000 people following his near-daily updates on Telegram. He posts videos and photos of his surroundings, his daily routine, and of how his camp is organised. Wood-chopping features heavily. Kalinin claims not to miss much about his previous life. He calls himself an introvert who doesn´t mind being alone, although he misses his wife and would like to see her more often. However, he points out that his current situation is still preferable to being sent to the front line or to prison. ""I´ve changed so much, that the kind of things I might have missed have faded into the background,"" he says. ""The things that seemed important before don´t have their power any more. There are people in a much worse situation than us.""Image source, Adam KalininImage caption, The snow is beginning to melt as the days get longer, Kalinin saysRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinMore on this story´I will break my arm, my leg... anything to avoid the draft´22 September 2022Russia´s Putin announces partial military mobilisation21 September 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

His remarks come after Ukraine´s defence minister said he had a ""frank discussion"" with his German counterpart about German Leopard 2 tanks, which Kyiv is urgently requesting to confront Russian armour.Germany has insisted that it is not blocking the delivery of German-made Leopard tanks, which other countries want to send.""We had a frank discussion on Leopards 2. To be continued,"" Oleksii Reznikov said after meeting Western allies on Friday.The meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany brought an agreement to supply more armoured vehicles, air defence systems and ammunition.On Saturday, an adviser to Mr Reznikov told the BBC that Nato countries committed to helping Ukraine need to be several steps ahead of the enemy. Yuriy Sak said that the West needed to redefine what it meant to stand with Ukraine - and that it did not simply mean stabilising Ukraine´s front line.""To be able to defend our land means to be able to de-occupy our land, to liberate our territories and for this we need heavy tanks, for this we need armoured vehicles,"" he said. The Leopard 2 is seen as a potential game-changer for Ukraine, as it is easy to maintain and designed specifically to compete with the Russian T-90 tanks, which are being used in the invasion.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said opinions remained divided over supplying Leopards, and he denied that Berlin was blocking such a move.Under German export laws, other countries who want to supply Leopards - like Poland and Finland - are unable to do so until Berlin gives the all-clear. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the Nato partners for their military assistance, but said ""we will still have to fight for the supply of modern tanks"".""Every day we make it more obvious that there is no alternative, that a decision about tanks must be made.""Ukraine´s current tanks are mostly old Soviet models, often outnumbered and outgunned by Russian firepower.More than 2,000 Leopards are sitting in warehouses all over Europe. President Zelensky believes about 300 of them could help to defeat Russia.Mr Pistorius said Berlin was prepared to move quickly if there was consensus among allies, though he could not say when a decision on the tanks might be made.Image source, EPAImage caption, Ukraine´s Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov (R) with Kyiv´s US and German allies in RamsteinGermany has found itself in a deadlock due to several factors including international diplomacy and the legacy of World War Two.It used to have a policy of not sending arms to conflict zones, but that was reversed following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Late last year, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Germany was now ""among the allies providing most military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine"", by supplying artillery, air defence systems and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.But Germany is reluctant to send Leopards unless they are part of a wider Nato package that preferably includes America´s powerful M1 Abrams tanks. The US has rejected this, saying the Abrams tanks are impractical for Ukraine´s forces because they are difficult and expensive to maintain.Regardless, there has been pressure in some corners for the US to send its tanks, and to persuade Germany to do the same.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin denied that Berlin was waiting for the US to make the first move. ""This notion of unlocking - in my mind it´s not an issue,"" he said after Friday´s meeting of 54 countries at Ramstein Air Base.Germany also remains haunted by the Nazi-era devastation it caused in World War Two, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been cautious about having anything to do with an escalation in Ukraine.A leading opposition Christian Democrat (CDU) politician in Germany, Johann Wadephul, condemned the government´s ""policy of refusal"" on the Leopards, saying it would affect Germany´s international reputation. ""What is Scholz waiting for?"" he asked. Poland´s Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau also criticised Germany´s reluctance. ""Arming Ukraine in order to repel the Russian aggression is not some kind of decision-making exercise. Ukrainian blood is shed for real. This is the price of hesitation over Leopard deliveries. We need action, now,"" he tweeted.Western countries have committed billions in other weaponry - but without Germany´s commitment on tanks, it was not the result Ukraine was hoping for.Other countries have committed to sending tanks, including the UK, which will send 14 Challenger 2s.The US announced fresh support worth more than $2.5bn (£2bn) this week, including armoured vehicles.The Pentagon promised an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other supplies.Nine European nations have also promised their own weapon support after meeting in Estonia on Thursday.

Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway last Friday, where he was detained by border guards. He is currently being held in the Oslo area where he faces charges of illegal entry to Norway, his lawyer Brynjulf Risnes told the BBC.Mr Risnes said his client left Wagner after witnessing war crimes in Ukraine. The Norwegian Border Guard confirmed to the BBC that a Russian man had been detained after crossing the country´s 198km (123 mile) long border with Russia, but said it could not comment further for ""reasons of security and privacy"". Tarjei Sirma-Tellefsen, police chief of staff in the Norwegian region of Finnmark, said a man had been detained by a border patrol and said he had applied for asylum. But the Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, who helped Mr Medvedev leave Russia, confirmed his identity. His escape is believed to be the first known instance of one of the group´s soldiers defecting to the West. Gulagu.net´s founder Vladimir Osechkin told the BBC that Mr Medvedev had joined the paramilitary group in July 2022 on a four-month contract, but had deserted after witnessing a host of human rights abuses and war crimes while serving in Ukraine. He said that Mr Medvedev is a former soldier in the Russian army and that he later served time in prison between 2017 and 2018 before joining the Wagner Group. He was placed in charge of a Wagner division in Ukraine, where the mercenary group supplied him with around 30-40 troops every week, Mr Osechkin said. In a video posted by Gulagu.net to its social media channels, Mr Medvedev said he fled Ukraine in November after being informed that the group intended to extend his contract indefinitely.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Ukraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesAfter spending two months underground in Russia, he crossed the border into Norway last week. Mr Risnes said his client had also witnessed a host of war crimes while fighting in Ukraine, including seeing ""deserters being executed"" by the Wagner Group´s internal security service. ""In short he felt betrayed and wanted to leave as soon as possible,"" Mr Risnes said. He added that he believed Mr Medvedev had taken some evidence of war crimes with him to Norway and that he intends to share his information with groups investigating war crimes in the coming weeks. In response, the founder of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, appeared to laugh off the allegations.In a press release from one of his companies, Prigozhin issued a sarcastic statement, linking Mr Medvedev to a non-existent Nordic mercenary unit and said he was a Norwegian citizen, in an apparent attempt to mock the man´s testimony.Prigozhin also accused him of ""mistreatment of prisoners"" and said that his former employee was ""very dangerous"". Mr Risnes told the BBC that the Wagner leader´s claims were not true. UK officials believe the Wagner Group makes up about 10% of Russia´s forces in Ukraine, and played a significant part in helping Moscow´s forces take the town of Soledar in eastern Donbas region last week. Thousands of its troops have been recruited from Russian prisons. Mr Prigozhin - a former convict himself - has promised recruits their freedom in exchange for six months service in Ukraine. Before the invasion of Ukraine, it had only a few thousand mercenaries. Most were believed to be experienced former soldiers, including some from Russia´s elite regiments and special forces.Since 2015, it is believed to have deployed troops to Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic.

The tanks would ""burn like all the rest,"" said Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin´s spokesman. ""They are just very expensive.""Mr Zelensky said he told Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that ""progress must be made in other aspects of our defence co-operation"" - with Ukraine seeking supplies of long-range missiles and artillery. He pressed not only for a prompt delivery of Western tanks but also for significant numbers: ""We must form such a tank force, such a freedom force that after it strikes, tyranny will never again rise up.""While Mr Zelensky is likely to focus now on equipping the Ukrainian air force with more technologically advanced fighter jets after securing the tanks, many Western governments remain opposed to such a move - fearing the aircraft could be used to strike targets inside Russia.In his speech to the Bundestag in Berlin on Wednesday outlining the details of the tanks plan, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz insisted there would be ""no fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine"".US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that the US would send 31 M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine.The decision to deliver the tanks was announced hours after Germany said it would send 14 of its Leopard 2s to the Ukrainian battlefield.Berlin also cleared the way for other European countries to donate German-made tanks from their own stocks.Ukraine has lobbied Western allies to send the equipment for months.It hailed the twin announcements as a turning point that would allow its military to regain momentum and take back occupied territory almost a year after Moscow invaded.It also said the tanks could help deter a potential Russian offensive in the spring. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Biden says tanks are not an offensive threat to RussiaAnnouncing the decision to put its tanks on the battlefield, US President Joe Biden said Mr Putin had expected Europe and the United States to ""weaken our resolve"", adding: ""He was wrong from the beginning and he continues to be wrong.""""We´re also giving Ukraine the parts and equipment necessary to effectively sustain these tanks in battle,"" he said. ""This is about helping Ukraine defend and protect Ukrainian land. It is not an offensive threat to Russia.""A Ukrainian tank battalion typically consists of 31 tanks, which is why that number has been agreed upon, Mr Biden added. The US decision, however, marks a reversal in their position as the Biden administration has insisted for some time that the heavy M1 Abrams tanks would be difficult to deliver, expensive to maintain and challenging for Ukrainian troops to operate.The US-made military vehicle is one of the most modern battle tanks in the world and requires extensive training to operate. The $400m (£323m) US package also includes eight recovery vehicles that can tow the tanks if they become stuck, as well as ammunition, equipment, and funding for training and maintenance.But it is likely to be many months before the tanks reach the battlefield. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there were no excess Abrams tanks in the US inventory. As such, they will have to be purchased from private contractors or bought from another country, The German-made Leopard 2 tanks, however, will be drawn from existing inventories and are expected to arrive in two to three months. They are widely seen as one of the most effective battle tanks available.The decision to send the heavy weapons follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling. Germany faced mounting international pressure to send the tanks, and there are reports that the eventual decision to do so was conditional on the US doing the same.When asked if the US decision was designed to give Germany cover to send tanks, Mr Kirby said: ""I wouldn´t use the word cover. What this decision does do is show how unified we are with our allies.""He attributed the change in Washington´s position to the conditions on the ground as well as Russia´s tactics, without giving further details.Ukrainian crews would soon be trained to use the Leopard tanks in Germany, officials in Berlin said. While the acquisition of tanks from the West will be considered a diplomatic coup for Mr Zelensky, he said on Tuesday that his country required at least 300 of them to defeat Russia.Several European countries have Leopard 2 tanks in their inventories, and the German decision means some of these can also be sent to Ukraine. Germany hopes around 90 will ultimately be delivered to the battlefield.Poland wants to export 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and Norway announced later on Wednesday that it would send some of its armoured vehicles - although it did not state how many.The UK was the first Nato member to donate modern tanks to Ukraine when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak´s government announced that 14 Challenger 2s - the British army´s main battle tank - would be provided.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyGermanyOlaf ScholzRussiaUkraineJoe BidenMore on this storyUkraine welcomes German tank move as ´first step´25 JanuaryWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?4 days ago´We need Western tanks - my tank´s as old as me´17 JanuaryWhy Germany delayed sending tanks to Ukraine25 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But Mr Zelensky told defence ministers at Ramstein airbase: ""Hundreds of thank yous are not hundreds of tanks.""Germany had faced growing pressure to send its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but at the end of Friday´s meeting had not yet committed to their supply. The nation was also under pressure to allow other countries to provide Ukraine with their own Leopard tanks. Under German law, the government in Berlin would have to give its permission before countries such as Poland or Finland could commit to re-exporting them.Speaking after the meeting, Poland´s defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak said he was hopeful building a coalition to support Ukraine would end ""in success"".Germany´s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, had earlier told reporters at Ramstein: ""None of us can say today when there will be a decision for Leopard tanks and what the decision may look like.""Defence colleagues from more than 50 countries gathered at the airbase on Friday, a day after several nations pledged more equipment to help Ukraine fend off further Russia campaigns. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told them it was time to ""dig deeper"".Almost 11 months into Russia´s war in Ukraine, Nato military figures believe Moscow is planning a renewed spring offensive with troop numbers bolstered by a partial mobilisation since the end of September.Western officials see a potential ""window of opportunity"" in the coming weeks for Ukraine to push Russian forces back. They say Moscow is running short of ammunition and trained troops - despite efforts to replenish stocks and mobilise additional forces. For its part, Russia has warned of increasing Nato involvement, direct as well as indirect, in the conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that sending tanks would not change the course of the conflict, but would ""create more problems for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people"".The UK has already announced it will send 14 Challenger 2 battle tanks. But Kyiv wants more tanks and UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he hoped that the 50 allies would ""all hear the message that unlocking the tank is part of 2023"".Germany´s Leopard tanks are key to that equation. They are in more plentiful supply than the British tank, and are operated by more than a dozen other nations. Ahead of the Ramstein meeting Mr Zelensky criticised Germany´s hesitant attitude to sending tanks, assuring Berlin that the Leopards would only be used in self-defence and not go through Russia. ""If you have Leopard [tanks], then give them to us,"" he told German public TV.Polish deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablonski indicated on Friday that Warsaw might be prepared to provide Ukraine with Leopards regardless of Berlin´s views. ""We´ll see. I think if there is strong resistance, we´ll be ready to take even such non-standard action. But let´s not anticipate the facts,"" he told Polish radio. Image source, ReutersImage caption, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is under pressure to allow Kyiv a supply of the Leopard 2 tank - pictured here last yearBerlin was reported this week to have made a decision on the Leopard conditional on the US agreeing to send Abrams tanks, which it is not intending to do. The defence minister denied Germany was blocking deliveries of the tank unilaterally and said that when a decision was made he wanted to be able to move fast.""That´s why this morning I told my ministry to make an inventory of the different types of Leopard tanks we have within our military but also within the industry.""There are fears of escalation in Berlin and of going it alone. Until recently, Germany refused requests to send a Patriot air defence battery, but it relented as soon as the US did the same. On tanks too, Berlin would like to see the US take the lead. Ben Wallace has rejected talk of escalation. Germany along with the US and UK, he argued, had already supplied artillery systems, like Himars, with a much longer range. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?German tanks for Ukraine to depend on US approvalUK to send 14 Challenger 2s to UkraineMr Zelensky has repeatedly taken aim at Berlin´s perceived hesitancy and on Thursday criticised suggestions that the US and Germany were only planning to commit vehicles if the other nation did the same. Retired US Army general David Petraeus said there was ""legitimate reluctance"" in Washington on the issue of sending Abrams tanks because they were difficult to maintain and had a jet turbine.He told the BBC it was ""imperative"" that any Western tank donations were made ""early enough, so [Ukrainian soldiers] can actually train on them"".On Thursday, Western nations pledged to send more vehicles, artillery and munitions to bolster the Ukrainian war effort.The US committed a new package worth $2.5bn (£2bn), saying this took its spend on Ukrainian support to $26.7bn since last February´s full-scale invasion by Russia.Tanks were not included in the offer, but the Pentagon did promise an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other provisions.The announcement came after nine European nations promised more support of their own following a meeting in Estonia. This included:UK - 600 Brimstone missilesDenmark - 19 French-made Caesar self-propelled howitzers (cannon)Estonia - howitzers, ammunition, support vehicles and anti-tank grenade launchersLatvia - Stinger air-defence systems, two helicopters, and dronesLithuania - anti-aircraft guns and two helicoptersPoland - S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 pieces of ammunitionCzech Republic - produce further large calibre ammunition, howitzers and APCsNetherlands - support expected to be detailed on FridayRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyCountries pledge heavy weapons for Ukraine20 JanuaryGerman tanks for Ukraine to depend on US approval19 January´We need Western tanks - my tank´s as old as me´17 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But what has emerged in recent days in Belgrade shows that the picture is not so black and white.Hinting at less-than-rosy relations with Moscow, President Vucic said that not only was Serbia ""neutral"" regarding the war in Ukraine, but that he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin for ""many months"".It is illegal for Serbs to take part in conflicts abroad. What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Tanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to goRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarThe number of Serbian recruits involved does not appear be significant. Some did fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine in 2014, but not with any sort of official endorsement. In fact, Serbian courts convicted more than two dozen people for taking part in ""fighting on foreign battlefronts"".On Thursday, a Belgrade-based lawyer and anti-war groups filed criminal complaints against the Russian ambassador as well as the head of Serbia´s state security and information agency (BIA) for allegedly recruiting Serbs for the Wagner group.In Belgrade, where provocative murals are numbingly common, the Wagner death´s head emblem appeared on a city-centre wall last week. It was signed by the People´s Patrols, an extreme right-wing organisation which has previously staged sparsely attended pro-Russia rallies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Serbia´s president Aleksandar Vucic made clear this week that his country´s trajectory was towards the WestNone of the mainstream political parties have even hinted at support for the invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, Serbia has consistently voted in favour of resolutions at the United Nations condemning Russia´s aggression. President Vucic this week made Belgrade´s position crystal clear: ""For us, Crimea is Ukraine, Donbas is Ukraine, and it will remain so."" The US expressed concerns to the Serbian leader last week about Wagner´s recruitment efforts, and US ambassador Christopher Hill said this week he was glad to hear that President Vucic could see ""the threat to peace and stability posed by Wagner potentially operating in Serbia"". But Mr Vucic´s stance has not been enough to impress the European Parliament, because Serbia has repeatedly refused to impose sanctions on Russia. For the second time, MEPs have passed a resolution calling for the suspension of membership negotiations until Serbia agrees to sanctions.For as long as the EU showed little enthusiasm for expanding the bloc to include the countries of the Western Balkans, it made sense for Serbia to maintain friendly ties with Moscow. It reminded Brussels that Belgrade had other options. Cheap gas supplies, Gazprom´s majority ownership of Serbia´s oil company NIS and Russia´s refusal to recognise Kosovo´s independence were practical reasons to stay on good terms.But the invasion of Ukraine has shifted perceptions. Belgrade was not impressed when President Putin referred to Kosovo´s unilateral declaration of independence as justification for recognising the independence of areas of occupied eastern Ukraine.Meanwhile, Brussels belatedly realised that its reticence towards the Western Balkans was leaving room for Moscow to meddle. Accession talks for Albania and North Macedonia were swiftly unblocked - and Bosnia received candidate status. So if Serbia´s president has been waiting for a moment to pivot decisively to the West, it might just have arrived. He has been warning of ""very difficult"" conversations with EU and US special envoys - and says he will address Serbs over the weekend to tell them ""what is required and expected from Serbia regarding Kosovo and sanctions against Russia"".Mr Vucic has made similar remarks before - without ever committing to a major policy change. But this week he once again reiterated that Serbia´s trajectory was towards the West.""I know that EU is our path,"" he told Bloomberg News. ""There are no other paths.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSerbiaRussiaBelgradeMore on this story´Sometimes it´s better to step back, then crush the enemy´19 JanuaryWagner Group commander requests asylum in Norway16 JanuaryFlight ban hits Russian minister´s visit to Serbia6 June 2022Thousands of pro-Russia Serbs march in Belgrade5 March 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The Russian national anthem plays.Then Channel One TV kicks off 2023 with a pop song:  ""I´m Russian and I will go all the way…I´m Russian, to spite the world.""Next on Top of the (patriotic) Pops: ""I was born in the Soviet Union, I was made in the USSR!""I change channels. At the Russia-1 New Year party, one of the station´s most famous war correspondents is holding a champagne glass, toasting 2023 and wishing for ""more good news than bad from the front line"". Sitting with him are men in military fatigues. A Moscow-installed official from Russian-occupied Ukraine declares: ""I wish us all peace. But peace will only come after our victory.""You get the gist. This year´s festive extravaganzas on Russian TV are a strange mixture of let´s party and let´s win on the battlefield. This is not normal TV fare for a New Year´s night in Russia. Then again, this is not a normal New Year´s night. ""Normal"" disappeared 10 months ago when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Putin is destroying you, Zelensky tells RussiansDeadly explosions hit Kyiv on New Year´s EveFive ways Ukraine war could go in 2023There was nothing ""normal"" about Vladimir Putin´s New Year address to the Russian people. For his annual speech the president normally stands alone outside the Kremlin. This year, standing behind him, were men and women in combat uniforms. In his speech last year, the Kremlin leader pointed out that ""New Year´s Eve is literally filled with good cheer and happy thoughts"".Good cheer and happy thoughts were in short supply this time round.President Putin used the address to promote the Kremlin´s alternative reality: that in this conflict Russia´s the hero and Ukraine and the West are the villains.""For years, Western elites hypocritically assured us of their peaceful intentions…but in fact, they encouraged the neo-Nazis in every possible way,"" President Putin said.""Defending our Motherland is the sacred duty we owe to our ancestors and descendants."" When the Kremlin talks about ""defending our Motherland"", keep in mind that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Not the other way around. Image source, Getty ImagesThe Russian President claims his country is benefiting enormously from the dramatic events of 2022: ""It was a year of… important steps towards Russia´s full sovereignty.""""We lay the foundation for our common future, our true independence.""The assertion that, in this war, Russia is fighting for its sovereignty and independence is puzzling, to say the least. For a start Russia has long been a sovereign, independent nation. Even if you accept Vladimir Putin´s premise that Russia never achieved ""full sovereignty"" the question arises: why not? Mr Putin´s been in power for 23 years. Long enough, you may think, to sort that. The other thing President Putin does in his new year address is to divide Russians into us and them, into those who support his ""special military operation"" and those who don´t.""It was a year that put many things in their place,"" the Kremlin leader said, ""and drew a clear line between courage and heroism, on the one hand, and betrayal and cowardice on the other…""In 2023 we´re likely to see the Kremlin drawing this line ever more clearly. The Russian authorities have mobilised all the country´s resources for the ""special military operation"". There is no room for debate or discussion: the government expects the public to rally round and to support the president.

But soldiers have told the BBC they´ve pulled back in a controlled and tactical move before a planned counter-attack. Long bursts of automatic gunfire rattled across the grey, stubbled fields on the front line between Soledar and the neighbouring town of Bakhmut, during an intense gun and artillery battle.""It´s quite close. One kilometre,"" said a tall Ukrainian unit commander named Andriy, peering around the corner of a ruined cottage and towards a dark line of trees to the east.It was impossible to be sure what was happening. But the sound of automatic gunfire, zinging overhead, in addition to the constant boom of rockets and artillery, suggested that Russian infantry were close. A press officer for the 46th Air Assault Brigade, who was accompanying us on a visit to the area, said the front lines were constantly shifting, unpredictably, sometimes by several kilometres a day.""We have a tough situation here,"" Andriy acknowledged, before slipping into a well-disguised command bunker hidden amid the ruins. His team had just received detailed information about a Russian armoured personnel carrier (APC), spotted by a Ukrainian drone. Moments later, there were three loud outgoing blasts from a nearby UK-supplied light artillery piece, used here by Ukrainian forces, and aimed at the vehicle.""Every day we destroy 50 or 100 enemy people,"" Andriy claimed.Image source, 46th Brigade Ukrainian militaryImage caption, The area around Bakhmut has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war in recent weeksThe fighting in and around Soledar has been some of the heaviest of the war, with Russian forces - spearheaded by the mercenaries and convicts of the Kremlin´s Wagner group - reportedly suffering heavy losses but finally succeeding in taking control of the small hill-top town, now a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble. Privately, some Ukrainian soldiers have blamed poor co-ordination between different units for the loss of Soledar and have acknowledged that Russia may now be better placed to encircle the far bigger and strategically more important neighbouring town of Bakhmut, to the south.But the mood among front line units in villages like Paraskoviivka, now just a few hundred metres from Russian positions, appears to be quietly confident. Furious Ukrainian air and artillery bombardments appear to be blocking Russian attempts to move forward both from the north and from the south-western outskirts of Bakhmut.""It´s a controlled situation. I believe in my commander. Sometimes it´s really better to take a step back… then after that to make a [counter] attack and crush the enemy. Each day we´re destroying enemy positions,"" said Andriy.On a grey morning this week, a light thaw turned the snowbound country lanes on the northern edge of Bakhmut into muddy tracks. During winter there is precious little cover from trees and bushes, leaving many roads visible and vehicles exposed to Russian artillery fire. As we took cover behind a small cottage, a shell crashed into the road 300m behind us. Our military escort said the fighting had reached a new pitch of intensity, with the boom of rockets and artillery fire coming every few seconds, amid the wail of sirens from Ukrainian ambulances whisking the wounded back to a field hospital.""We have gun(shot) wounds, we have shrapnel wounds. The fighting here seems to be particularly intense. We also have (cases of) frostbite and flu. And people are tired,"" said Dr Andriy Zholob, the commander of the 46th Brigade´s medical unit. But he insisted morale among the soldiers remained high.""They´re tired, they´re cold, they´re wounded. But they ask me, ´Doc, when can I return?´ They don´t want to say - ´I´m wounded, now I can relax.´ Their hearts are burning still. We have work to do,"" said Dr Zholob, scrolling through a video showing him removing mortar shrapnel from a soldier´s shoulder.Closer to Bakhmut, two Ukrainian jets roared overhead, as artillery and tanks, hidden in the fields, continued to pound Russian positions.

However, he had not long been a member of the Ukrainian government.He became the country´s interior minister in July 2021, just six months before Russia invaded the country.Born in the western city of Khmelnytsky in 1980, he initially pursued a legal career in private practice, but entered politics in 2014.Recruited as a legal expert, he was part of the team behind Volodymyr Zelensky´s successful longshot bid for the presidency in 2019.As a member of the president´s Servant of the People party, he was elected to the parliament that same year and swiftly assumed a prominent role as head of the parliamentary committee on law enforcement affairs.But his move to front-bench politics came in the wake of the sudden and unexpected resignation of the previous interior minister, Arsen Avakov, a political heavyweight who had held the post under four different administrations.There had been rumours that Mr Zelensky was preparing to fire Mr Avakov, who was seen as standing in the way of the president´s attempts to tackle corruption.At the time, the appointment of Mr Monastyrsky was interpreted as consolidating the president´s grip on power.As interior minister, Mr Monastyrsky was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine.When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he rose to the challenge of rallying international support for Kyiv´s fightback.He gave interviews to the world´s press warning of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and highlighting the challenges faced by Ukraine´s emergency services, which also come under the interior ministry´s control.He also played a key role in updating the Ukrainian public on casualties caused by Russian missile strikes.His friend and MP Mariia Mezentseva said it was ""a tragedy for everyone"" as Mr Monastyrsky´s ministry was playing a key role in Ukraine´s response to the invasion.""He responded 24/7 to his colleagues, friends and family. He was very close to President Zelensky from day one of his presidential campaign,"" she told the BBC.""We will always remember him as a very bright, smiley, friendly, patriotic person and a civil servant of Ukraine,"" she added.""I have no words.  I´m trying to keep calm but this is very hard, this is very hard because this is a tragedy for everyone.""Also killed in the same helicopter crash was Mr Monastyrsky´s deputy, Yevgeny Enin, a former intelligence officer and top lawyer who had been in his post since September 2021.Ukraine´s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the men as ""true Ukrainian patriots"" and said their deaths were a ""huge loss for us all"".

It is nearly four months since Russian troops were forced to retreat from here, pushed back some 25km (about 15 miles) to the east. But the boom of artillery fire, close to the front lines, is still audible every few minutes, and this town - much of it in ruins - is not yet safe from Russian missiles.""I live on the seventh floor. The rocket hit the fifth floor, early this morning, at around five. But I´m fine,"" says Alexander Rogovitz, a 73-year-old retired businessman and the only remaining resident of a large apartment block on the edge of town. He bends over to share out some dried food to the eight cats - seven of them strays, abandoned by neighbours - he now looks after.That resilience, and a strong collective spirit, seem to be widespread here, among those who have clung on amid the snow and rubble.Image caption, Valeri Dmitrenko has been sheltering in a basement with 21 neighbours for the past nine monthsIn a nearby courtyard, beside a giant bomb crater, a 45-year-old railway technician named Valeri Dmitrenko is busy chopping wood to heat the basement where he and 21 neighbours have been sheltering for the past nine months. Lyman still has no running water or central heating system, and the daytime temperature has been hovering around freezing.""What can we do?"" Valeri shrugs, stroking the head of a stray dog he and his wife, Ira, recently adopted and named Princess Diana. When he´s not busy with his axe, Valeri helps neighbours repair broken doors and windows in their badly damaged apartment building.Ira walks past, hurriedly, with buckets of water she has pumped from a well in the yard.""I still find it stressful to stay outside, in the open, for long,"" says Ira, a 41-year-old accountant, before heading down a dark flight of stairs and into the cramped cellar of 6 Railway Street.Despite heavy fighting continuing in the Donbas, civilians are trickling back to liberated Ukrainian towns close to the front line - against the advice of local authorities. In Lyman, devastated by Russian forces last year, some 13,000 residents are living, precariously, in gruelling winter conditions.Image caption, An apartment block in Lyman, which has been part-destroyed by Russian missile strikesAs Russia´s forces approached Lyman last June, 41,000 civilians fled, leaving about 10,000 people behind. Many of those were elderly, or poor - or, like Ira and Valeri, had sick relatives who refused to leave. For the next four months, about 60 people squeezed into the same cellar on Railway Street.""It was difficult at times. People are different. Some became aggressive - we´re not used to living all together like this,"" says Ira. Adding to that stress was the fact that, by Ira´s reckoning, about a third of those who had chosen to stay in the cellar were pro-Russian, actively hoping that Ukraine would lose the war.""Yes, there were people who supported Russia. But they left when Ukraine started liberating territory. When the so-called Russian authorities moved out, they went with them, taking their children. Probably because they were scared of what would happen to them here,"" adds Ira.On 3 October, Lyman was liberated by Ukrainian forces and soon afterwards the town´s mayor, Alexander Zhuravlov, returned to discover that ""80%, maybe 90%"" of the buildings had been damaged or destroyed. The railway lines that pass through the centre of town are still a mass of broken overhead cables and blocked tracks.In recent months, the mayor and his team have managed to restore electricity to most of the town and the surrounding villages. Pensions are now being paid, on time, and some shops have reopened. Image caption, Ira, one of those sheltering in a basement, says she finds it stressful being outsideThe government and humanitarian groups have brought in wood stoves and distributed logs. Every day one aid group brings in hundreds of packed lunches to distribute free of charge. There are roughly 700 children living in Lyman and the mayor estimates that another 3,000 residents have returned since the town was liberated. But he´s urging the rest to stay away.""At the moment we do not recommend people to return here. On the contrary, they´re better off in safer places and cities. There are no comfortable living places here, for now. People will be accepted in other regions and will be provided with accommodation and food,"" he says, driving to the site of a two-week-old missile attack that ripped the entire wall off a nine-storey apartment block.The mayor says local police are still dealing with ""a handful"" of Lyman´s residents suspected of working for the Russian occupiers. But he believes the experience of the past year has persuaded many pro-Russian residents to change their views.""I think those people now understand that they made a mistake. They were led astray by the media - watching Russian propaganda on television every night and thinking it was the truth. They were in a minority, and they have already changed their minds. They see that this Russian world is not the one they´d been led to expect,"" says Zhuravlyov.Image caption, Aid groups provide food, which is distributed free of charge, to those in need in LymanA 62-year-old woman called Valentina, queueing for food at the local hospital, seems to reflect that change of heart, when asked about the security situation in Lyman since it was liberated. In recent months, pro-Russian civilians have often hinted at their allegiance by implying that both sides are equally guilty of shelling towns, and that it is therefore impossible to assign blame.""The bombardment hasn´t stopped. The shells still hit the town. We don´t know who is firing,"" she begins.But then, unprompted, Valentina changes her mind.""I suppose it must be the Russians. Yes, no doubt,"" she says, adding: ""We´re Ukrainians. This is a Ukrainian town. The shops are open. Our pensions come on time.

""There are risks, but it´s important to inspire our fighters, feel the situation on the front line and make decisions first-hand,"" says Volodymyr Fesenko, a political expert from Ukraine´s Centre for political studies.Because the Interior Ministry is responsible for the National Guard, emergency services and the police force, Mr Fesenko believes the risks for Denys Monastyrsky were higher than for other ministers. Who was Ukrainian minister Denys Monastyrsky?""It´s impossible to assess and forecast everything in advance. For those who travel by helicopter the risk exists, especially during the war,"" he says.The cause of the crash in Brovary still isn´t known. Helicopter is often the method of choice for senior figures to travel around Europe´s biggest country.""When the officials move faster, they can do more,"" points out Anton Herashchenko, a former MP who was an advisor to interior minister. Monastyrsky used to be his assistant and consultant.""You wouldn´t travel to the US by ship, would you?"" Herashchenko says.We experienced helicopter travel ourselves when we joined a trip with Monastyrsky´s Interior Ministry last summer, from Kyiv to the city of Zaporizhzhia.Image caption, An identical state emergency helicopter turned a seven-hour drive into a flight of two hours and 45 minutesAt times it did feel like we were on a ship on choppy water - only the sea had been replaced with the green vastness of Ukraine. There´d be the occasional feeling of free fall as the helicopter vaulted over electricity pylons.For the entire trip we travelled at tree-level. There were moments where it felt like we were going to scrape someone´s roof.The reason for our altitude? To avoid being detected by Russian forces.""Because their life is important for the defence of their country, they have some level of protection,"" explains Mr Herashchenko. ""But no one is protected against a missile, like the one which hit the residential block in Dnipro"".At the other end of our journey, Denys Monastyrsky assessed troops taking part in drills in case of a radioactive leak. The nearby nuclear powerplant in the city of Enerhodar has long been under Russian control.He then took questions from journalists, before heading back to Kyiv. A 700-mile round trip. I have seen Mr Monastyrsky make several public appearances since Russia´s full-scale invasion. I remember his convoy suddenly pulling over in Kyiv´s Independence Square on 28 February.At the time it was feared Russia could be in the city at any moment, but it didn´t stop him from holding a short notice press conference. Image caption, Denys Monastyrsky speaking to the media in Kyiv in the early days of Russian invasion""Police officers, border guards and emergency workers are doing all they can to bring victory closer and faster,"" he told us.More recently I saw Mr Monastyrsky arrive at the scene of a missile strike in Zaporizhzhia last September. Thirty-two people had been killed, there were fears of a second attack, but he still came.As one official reminded us: ""It´s dangerous for everyone in Ukraine at the moment, for ministers and anyone else.""Ukraine´s President Zelensky has also embraced the risks of being a wartime leader.Standout moments included his appearance in the liberated city Kherson on 14 November. The Russians had only pulled out a couple of days before and were just across the Dnipro River.Image caption, ""This is just the beginning,"" claimed President Zelensky on Kherson´s main squareBefore his landmark visit to Washington, Ukraine´s leader travelled to the eastern city of Bakhmut to address troops. At the time Russian forces were a mile or so away. Some of the heaviest fighting was happening there.These visits are a stark contrast with Russian President Vladimir Putin´s more cautious approach of not visiting the front lines.

Ukrainian blood is shed for real. This is the price of hesitation over Leopard deliveries. We need action, now,"" Zbigniew Rau wrote on Twitter. Western countries have committed billions in other weaponry - but without Germany´s commitment on tanks, it was not the result Ukraine was hoping for.Ukraine wants German-made Leopard 2s as they are easy to maintain and designed specifically to compete with the Russian T-90 tanks, which are being used in the invasion.There are believed to be more than 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks worldwide and President Zelensky believes about 300 of them would help ensure it can defeat Russia.However, under German export laws, other countries who want to supply German-made Leopard 2s - like Poland and Finland - are unable to do so until Berlin gives the all-clear.Ukraine already has tanks, but they are old, Soviet-era machines, prone to breaking down and without the upgraded armour and sophisticated laser range-finders found on modern Nato tanks.The country knows its best, perhaps only, chance of fending off the massed assault Russia is expected to launch in the coming months is fielding a sizable force of western-supplied armour.Mr Zelensky said there was ""no alternative"" to supplying his country with tanks in a video address on Friday evening: ""Each arrangement must be carried out as quickly as possible - for our defence.""Macron plans big boost for French defence budgetUS to designate Russia´s Wagner as a criminal groupEarlier this week, Germany was reported to have made a decision on providing the tanks - which would be done on the condition the US agreed to send its advanced M1 Abrams tank. But speaking after Friday´s meeting of 54 countries at Ramstein air base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin denied Berlin was waiting on the US to make the first move.""This notion of unlocking - in my mind it´s not an issue,"" he said.Speaking of Germany´s wider contribution to the defence of Ukraine, Mr Austin, said: ""They are a reliable ally, they´ve been that way for a very, very long time and I truly believe that they´ll continue to be a reliable ally going forward.""He told reporters other countries were providing tanks to Ukraine: ""I don´t have any announcements to make on M1s [Abrams tanks] and you heard the German minister of defence say that they´ve not made a decision on Leopards.""Other countries have committed to sending tanks, including the UK, which will send 14 Challenger 2s.Despite hesitation over the Abrams tanks, the US announced fresh support worth more than $2.5bn (£2bn) this week, including armoured vehicles.The Pentagon promised an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other supplies.Nine European nations have also promised more support of their own after meeting on Thursday in Estonia. They included:UK - 600 Brimstone missilesDenmark - 19 French-made Caesar self-propelled howitzers (cannon)Estonia - howitzers, ammunition, support vehicles and anti-tank grenade launchersLatvia - Stinger air-defence systems, two helicopters, and dronesLithuania - anti-aircraft guns and two helicoptersPoland - S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 pieces of ammunitionCzech Republic - produce further large calibre ammunition, howitzers and APCsNetherlands - support expected to be detailed on FridayFor now, this leaves Ukraine in limbo - receiving armoured vehicles and air defence systems, but not the armour it so desperately needs.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyGermanyUkraineMore on this storyWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?4 days agoGive us tanks, says Zelensky, as Western allies meet20 JanuaryGerman tanks for Ukraine to depend on US approval19 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

US says Iran now Russia´s ´top military backer´War will be ´at reduced tempo´ for months, says USIn a series of briefings to the media, Ukraine´s Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said evidence was mounting that Russia, which has suffered a series of battlefield losses, plans a broad new offensive. He speculated this could occur in February when half of the 300,000 troops conscripted by Russia in October to support the Ukraine war would complete training.""The second part of the mobilisation, 150,000 approximately... do a minimum of three months to prepare. It means they are trying to start the next wave of the offensive probably in February, like last year. That´s their plan,"" Mr Reznikov told the Guardian.""The Kremlin is trying to find new solutions [for] how to get the victory,"" he added, stating that he expects Russia to further mobilise more citizens.Moscow´s new offensive could happen as soon as January but more likely in the spring, the Economist reported on Thursday, saying the assessment came from President Zelensksy, General Valery Zaluzhny and General Oleksandr Syrskyi in recent interviews.""The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops. I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv,"" said General Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine´s armed forces.Russia is ""100% being prepared"", he said, adding that Ukraine´s ""very important strategic task...is to create reserves and prepare for the war, which may take place in February, at best in March, and at worst at the end of January"".""It may start not in Donbas, but in the direction of Kyiv, in the direction of Belarus, I do not rule out the southern direction as well,"" he said.Both sides have ruled out a Christmas truce and there are currently no talks aimed at ending the conflict.Military analysts say a winter deadlock could set in, even as fierce fighting continues, especially in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces are pushing to capture the town of Bakhmut.Ukraine has significantly improved its air defences against Russian missiles with Western support, but is calling for more advanced weaponry. On Thursday, western allies stepped up their support with additional funding and military training.European Union leaders agreed to provide €18bn (£15.7bn) in financing to Ukraine next year and hit Moscow with a ninth package of sanctions. In Washington, the US military announced it will expand training in Germany of Ukrainian military personnel. Starting in January, 500 troops a month will be trained, building on more than 15,000 Ukrainians trained by the US and its allies since April.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaUkraineMore on this storyDeadly attack leaves whole of Kherson without power15 December 2022Explosions in central Kyiv after air raid warning14 December 2022Ukraine war: Can we expect peace talks to begin?2 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Shrewsbury area manager for the fire service, Adam Matthews, told BBC Radio Shropshire taking part in the mission was a ""chance in a lifetime"".""It´s a bit of a cliché, but we do talk about the firefighting family a lot… It´s not just the UK fire and rescue service... it goes across the world,"" he said.""We´re well aware of the current situation in Ukraine and we´re all wanting to help.""I´ve been quite humbled to have been chosen to go and I´m sure it will be an emotional moment when we get to the other end and actually hand that equipment over knowing what difference its going to make.""Chief fire officer Rod Hammerton said of the participants: ""It´s not going to be an easy ride and they are giving up their own time to deliver vital, and potentially lifesaving, supplies."" Each engine will be equipped with a mechanic and a medical support team for the journey.Along the way, the volunteers will get overnight accommodation in a mixture of homestays and fire stations.Once in Poland they will return to the UK, while their donations cross the border into Ukraine.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Lemekhani Nyirenda died in September but Russian officials only informed Zambian authorities last month. The 23-year-old, a student at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, had been serving nine years in prison for a drug offence.He was given an amnesty in exchange for fighting for Russia in Ukraine, according to the Zambian government.Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo said last week that after asking for an explanation about how Nyirenda had ended up in Ukraine, ""we were informed that Russia allows for prisoners to be provided an opportunity for pardon in exchange for participation in the special military operation"", which is how Russia refers to its war in Ukraine.Mr Kakubo said the information had come from his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.The student was sent to the frontline by the Russian mercenary group Wagner, which has been recruiting prisoners. The group´s head Yevgeny Prigozhin said last month in a Telegram statement that the student had voluntarily joined up before dying ""a hero"".In September, leaked footage showed Mr Prigozhin outlining the rules of fighting, such as no deserting or sexual contact with Ukrainian women, and then giving the prisoners five minutes to decide if they want to sign up.Ominously, he told the prisoners he would get them out of jail alive but said he could not promise to bring them back alive.Africa Live: More stories from across the continent. Nyirenda´s body arrived in the capital Lusaka on Sunday and has been handed over to pathologists for examination. The body will be given to the family for burial after a post-mortem has been completed, family spokesperson Dr Ian Banda said in a statement.""The overarching thing for the family now is closure. Once everything has been concluded, they want to be able to bury him in line with our African traditions, to convene a vigil and mourn… to bury him in a dignified manner,"" he told the BBC.He said the family was ""relieved"" to have Nyirenda´s body returned to Zambia.His older sister Muzang´alu Nyirenda told the BBC in an earlier interview that the family wanted answers - saying they had been ""robbed of a life with him"".The drugs arrestNyirenda was working as a part-time courier when he was arrested in 2020 with a parcel containing drugs, his sister said.""We believe he didn´t know what was in the package he delivered, he told us he didn´t. He would get text messages for pick-ups and instructions on where to deliver them,"" she said.""On one occasion he was stopped by the police and searched and they found drugs in the package. He explained he was working for an online courier and didn´t know about the parcels but he was arrested,"" Ms Nyirenda said.The family, however, always remained hopeful that he would return home safely.Zambia has taken a neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine war, like many other African countries, but says it condemns any form of war.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warZambiaRussiaMore on this storyFamily´s grief at Zambian´s shock death in Ukraine16 November 2022Wagner boss: It´s prisoners fighting, or your children16 September 2022Africa is a hostage of Russia´s war, Zelensky says20 June 2022Around the BBCAfrica Today podcastTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

""I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space,"" Mr Musk tweeted.Last week, the Tesla CEO asked his 107.7 million followers to vote on ways to resolve the Ukraine war.The suggestions included a proposal to hold votes in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia that the Kremlin says it has annexed. His comments were welcomed by Moscow.The multi-billionaire said: ""Russia leaves if that is will of the people.""President Putin has already declared four Ukrainian regions to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.Mr Musk also suggested the world should ""formally"" recognise Crimea - illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014 - as part of Russia.In a newsletter, Mr Bremmer wrote that Mr Musk told him the Russian president was ""prepared to negotiate"", but only if Crimea remained under Russian control, if Ukraine accepted a form of permanent neutrality, and if Kyiv recognised Russia´s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Mr Bremmer said the SpaceX boss told him that Mr Putin said these goals would be accomplished ""no matter what"" and that there was the potential of a nuclear strike if Ukraine invaded Crimea.But Mr Musk has since denied the reports.No, it is not. I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 11, 2022
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMr Musk´s initial poll caused widespread controversy. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said people proposing Ukraine give up on its people and land ""must stop using word ´peace´ as an euphemism to ´let Russians murder and rape thousands more innocent Ukrainians, and grab more land´"". Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov called Mr Musk´s tweet ""moral idiocy, repetition of Kremlin propaganda, a betrayal of Ukrainian courage & sacrifice"".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov welcomed Mr Musk´s suggestions, stating: ""It is very positive that somebody like Elon Musk is looking for a peaceful way out of this situation."" Early in the war, the billionaire gained widespread popularity in Ukraine after sending a number of his Starlink internet terminals to the country. He was subsequently invited to visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But his recent tweets have seen that relationship sour, with Mr Zelensky last week hitting out at his Twitter polls.

Much of the damage has been caused in recent weeks with Russian forces trying to seize the town, after months in which they have failed to take a single key town or city in Ukraine.The strategic significance of Soledar is disputed by military analysts but if Russia succeeds in establishing full control over the town it would be a symbolic victory for the Kremlin. Russia´s notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group has been heavily involved in the battle for the town, with its head Yevgeny Prigozhin at one point claiming his fighters were in full control and that only his troops took part. However, Russia´s defence ministry has insisted its forces are involved.Ukraine´s defence ministry said on Wednesday that heavy fighting continues, and Wagner forces have had no success in breaking through Ukrainian defences.The images released by Maxar, a US-based space technology company, show how Ukrainian trenches in fields around the town have been targeted by Russian artillery. Success in Soledar may help Russia in its assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, about 10km (6 miles) to the south west, providing it with a secure artillery position within range of the city.The town also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.Taking Bakhmut would be a ""much needed boost for Russian forces in the east who have been under real pressure since September"", says Edward Arnold, from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), although he adds it would have ""little strategic significance for the outcome of the war"".The city has itself been devastated by months of fierce fighting, with Russia continuing its assault there even as its forces were pushed back elsewhere in Ukraine.Design by Gerry Fletcher and Erwan RivaultRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyConflicting claims over embattled Ukraine town10 JanuaryUkraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forces11 JanuaryWhy the battle for a Ukrainian salt town matters11 JanuaryDefying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´4 JanuaryFive ways Ukraine war could go in 202327 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov will now lead what Mr Putin terms a ""special military operation"". Gen Gerasimov replaces Sergei Surovikin who has overseen recent brutal attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure.The reshuffle comes as Russians claim they are making progress in eastern Ukraine after suffering a series of military defeats in recent months. Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine on 24 February. Gen Gerasimov, who has been in post since 2012, is the longest-serving Russian chief of general staff of the post-Soviet era.Gen Surovikin - now his deputy - has been dubbed ""General Armageddon"" for his brutal tactics in previous wars, including Russia´s operations in Syria and the heavy bombardment of the city of Aleppo in particular.Shortly after he was appointed to lead the operation in October, Russia began its campaign to destroy Ukraine´s energy infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainian civilians without power or running water for extended periods in the depths of winter. He also oversaw Russia´s withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson - a major success for the Ukrainians. Why the battle for a Ukrainian salt town mattersUkraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesDefying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´Russia´s defence ministry said the decision to replace Gen Surovikin was aimed at organising ""closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces"".But the move has been seen by some as a sign that he may have gained too much power. ""As the unified commander in Ukraine, Surovikin was becoming very powerful, and was likely bypassing [Russian Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu and Gerasimov when talking to Putin,"" military analyst Rob Lee wrote on Twitter.Some of Russia´s hawkish military bloggers, who support the war but frequently criticise the way it is being carried out, have been highly critical of Russia´s military leadership, including the new head of the special operation, Gen Gerasimov.Wednesday´s announcement comes as fighting continues in Soledar.The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the strategic city of Bakhmut, about 10km (six miles) to the south-west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.  Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.Russia´s mercenary Wagner Group has taken full credit for ""storming"" it. On Tuesday night, the group´s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces were in full control of Soledar. However, on Wednesday the Russian defence ministry released a statement appearing to contradict his claim - or that only Wagner group troops were involved. This led to Mr Prigozhin repeating the claim on Wednesday evening. In a short statement on Telegram, he boasted that his mercenaries had killed around 500 pro-Ukraine troops. ""The whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers,"" he wrote. Ukraine has recently made similar comments about piles of Russian bodies. There is no independent confirmation.The US-based Maxar Technologies company has published pictures of Soledar from August and early January, showing the scale of destruction during the recent fighting.Before (Aug 1, 2022) & after (Jan 10, 2023) #satellite imagery showing the magnitude of the ongoing fighting between Russian & Ukrainian forces.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe apparent differences in Russia´s official narrative surrounding the latest events around Soledar hint at divisions in the country´s military leadership, particularly between the Wagner Group and the defence ministry. For his part, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that Soledar had fallen. ""The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend"" to have achieved some successes in Soledar, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Wednesday, ""but the fighting continues"".""We do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defence. Our potential is growing,"" he added.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Video shows fighting in Soledar, Ukraine, but the BBC has been unable to confirm the date these videos were filmedRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyWhy the battle for salt town matters11 JanuaryUkraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forces11 JanuaryDefying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´4 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

If Russian forces seize the eastern town of Soledar, their hope is that the course of the war could change.Who controls Soledar?When Russian mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin announced his Wagner units had taken control of the entire territory of Soledar, the images produced looked convincing.But Wagner fighters are not part of the regular Russian armed forces and the defence ministry in Moscow says the battle is still going on. Ukraine´s president also says the fight is continuing and Kyiv is adamant the Russians are not succeeding in their push to capture the town.Why Soledar mattersThe fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, about 10km (6 miles) to the south west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.  Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.In video posted on a Russian Telegram channel, which the BBC has not yet been able to verify, Mr Prigozhin is apparently seen alongside Wagner soldiers in a Soledar salt mine. The mines have an extensive underground network of tunnels, which could be of strategic importance as Russian forces attempt to penetrate Ukrainian-controlled territory.  It is not clear, however, how much of this network is accessible and where it might lead.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Wagner boss Yevgeniy Prigozhin in a picture claiming to show the mercenaries in a Soledar salt mineSoledar´s mines also contain valuable salt and gypsum, which could provide an important source of revenue for anyone who controls and is able to extract resources from it.But perhaps one of the most important factors in the battle for Soledar is a symbolic one. ""The reason they are throwing everything at it,"" says the BBC´s James Waterhouse in Ukraine, ""is that there is a big propaganda win here… a vital trophy for President Vladimir Putin to present to critics back in Russia"".The importance of BakhmutTaking control of the nearby city Bakhmut would certainly be a prize for Russian forces in the region. ""This would be a much needed boost for Russian forces in the east who have been under real pressure since September,"" says Edward Arnold, a European security researcher at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). However, he adds that ""the seizure of Bakhmut will have little strategic significance for the outcome of the war"". The role of mercenariesThe Wagner Group has become increasingly influential in the Ukraine conflict and Mr Prigozhin has been behind its advance on the battlefield.He claims his fighters are the only ones fighting in Soledar, although the Russian defence ministry says its forces are also taking part.The battle for Soledar and Bakhmut is only part of the front line and the broader campaign is not going well for Vladimir Putin.Russia again replaced the head of its regular forces in Ukraine only three months after he was put in place, in another sign of dissatisfaction at the lack of progress.""[Prigozhin will] continue to use both confirmed and fabricated Wagner Group success in Soledar and Bakhmut,"" says the Institute for the Study of War ""to promote [it] as the only Russian force in Ukraine capable of securing tangible gains.""Soledar: Ukraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesWagner has also been prominent in conflict zones in Africa, invited in by governments battling insurgent rebel forces. In doing so, the mercenaries have often taken control of valuable mining resources.

The original remark caused widespread anger in the country, and was used by Russian officials to blame Ukraine.The adviser is a well-known figure because of his daily updates on YouTube, watched by millions. Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky has not yet commented on Mr Arestovych´s decision to resign.Hours after Saturday´s missile strike hit an apartment building in Dnipro, Mr Arestovych initially said it appeared that the Russian missile had fallen on the building after it was shot down by Ukrainian air defences. Ukraine said the building was hit by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which it does not have the capability to shoot down and is reportedly extremely inaccurate. Ukrainians reacted angrily to Mr Arestovych´s initial comments, with some accusing him of strengthening the position of Russian propagandists. Some Ukrainian parliamentarians signed a petition calling for Mr Arestovych to be dismissed as a government official. He later posted a letter tendering his resignation and said he had made a ""fundamental error"". ""I offer my sincere apologies to the victims and their relatives, the residents of Dnipro and everyone who was deeply hurt by my prematurely erroneous version of the reason for the Russian missile striking a residential building,"" he wrote in a longer post on Telegram. Mr Arestovych is one of the most public Ukrainian faces of the war, using his YouTube channel to hold daily discussions on issues related to the conflict. The channel has more than 1.6 million subscribers, and his videos often have more than 200,000 views. Unusually for Ukrainian officials, he speaks in Russian rather than Ukrainian. Before his resignation offer, his comments had been used by Russian officials to blame Kyiv for the strike. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian attacks ""do not strike residential buildings"" and suggested it was caused by Ukrainian air defences, a conclusion he said had also been reached by ""some representatives of the Ukrainian side"".Ukrainian officials have so far said that at least 44 people died in Saturday´s strikes with several others missing, and that there is ""minimal"" chance of finding others alive.Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa were also hit on Saturday in attacks which Moscow said were targeted at Ukraine´s military and energy infrastructure.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkraineMore on this storyShock at image of Ukraine kitchen wrecked by missile16 January´Minimal´ chance of more survivors from Dnipro flats16 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Ukraine´s allies have stepped up the supply of weapons, with the US vowing to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia.Western officials say Russia is being hampered in its efforts in the east.Last week, Russia launched a major offensive to seize the Donbas region after withdrawing from areas around the capital Kyiv. But according to one official, Russian forces are ""finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses"".In another development, the European Commission has accused Russia of blackmail after Moscow cut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria.The Commission´s President, Ursula von der Leyen said it showed Russia´s ""unreliability"" as a supplier. The Kremlin said Russia had been forced into the action by the ""unfriendly steps"" of Western nations.Gazprom´s cut-off follows Poland and Bulgaria´s refusal to pay for gas in Russian roubles - a demand made by President Vladimir Putin in March, which was designed to shore up the faltering currency battered by Western sanctions.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: A statue that was a symbol of Russian and Ukrainian friendship is dismantled in KyivMr Putin made his comments speaking to Russian lawmakers in the northern city of St Petersburg on Wednesday.  ""If someone from the outside tries to intervene in Ukraine and create strategic threats for Russia, our response will be lightning fast,"" he said.""We have all the tools [to respond] that no one can boast of. And we will not be bragging about them, we will use them if necessary.""The Russian leader added that all decisions on what that response would include had already been made - without providing any further details.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and within days President Putin ordered his military to put Russia´s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.Analysts suggest such threats are an attempt by Mr Putin to warn Ukraine´s allies not to intervene more in the conflict. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine?Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?President Putin was speaking a day after Western nations held a summit in Germany, promising to ramp up military support for Ukraine.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine won the war.There has recently been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany´s announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy.Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains.""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said.Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don´t like to fight in the rain,"" an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties.They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say it´s surprising that they still choose not to do so.Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example).Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a ""remarkable"" ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot.Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine.War in Ukraine: More coverageDONBAS: Facing the Russian Army on the front lineUKRAINE: Why India is buying more Russian oilODESA ATTACK: ´My world was destroyed by a Russian missile´READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisisRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warGazpromRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storySymbol of Russian and Ukrainian friendship destroyed.

""I used to drive one of these nearly 40 years ago - I can´t believe I´m doing it again. But it works. It does the job.""""But a Leopard would be better,"" said Volodymr, another member of their three-man crew, with a low chuckle.Plans to send German-made Leopard tanks and UK Challengers to the front lines here in the Donbas have been greeted with visible excitement by Ukrainian forces, who have been taking heavy casualties in recent weeks, around Bakhmut, and, more particularly, during the ferocious struggle for the nearby town of Soledar.""There were very heavy losses. It´s very pitiful. It´s hard,"" said Danylo, an officer in charge of repairing tanks for the 24th Mechanised Brigade. He said the current deadlock would not be broken unless foreign tanks arrived in significant numbers.""Yes, we´ll be stuck here. We need these [Western tanks] to stop Russia´s aggression. With infantry, covered by tanks, we´ll win for sure,"" he said.""Leopards, Challengers, Abrams - any foreign tank is good for us! I think we need at least 300. And we need them now!"" said Bogdan. The Ukrainians all acknowledged that Russia had more modern tanks but were scathing about their tactics.""The Russian tanks are a bit better than ours. They´re fully modernised. But mostly the Russians are strong because they push forwards en masse, advancing over the bodies of their own soldiers. Our commanders care more about the lives of their crews, so we try to destroy [the enemy] while losing as few of our own men as possible,"" said Bogdan.A more senior company commander in the 24th Brigade, with the code name Khan, took us to a rear position, past fresh trenches being dug in the fields by specialised machines, where several tanks were hidden under camouflage nets in a wooded area.Image source, Joe PhuaImage caption, Russian and Ukrainian forces are deadlocked on the eastern front lines""These T-72s have proved effective in winter conditions. But they´re old, and not really suited for modern warfare. These days it´s all about drones and the latest technology."" Khan said he believed it would take very little time for his crews to adapt to more modern European equipment.""If you´re a tank driver you´re already someone of above-average intelligence. They´ll be able to learn and adapt quickly,"" he said. Suddenly, an incoming Russian artillery shell landed several hundred metres away. Seconds later, another landed closer, and then closer still, sending soldiers and journalists diving for cover. The war in Ukraine has, in many ways, been a distinctly old-fashioned conflict, based on attrition, on devastating artillery strikes, and on dug-in positions reminiscent of the trenches of World War One. But the war has also revealed the limitation of tanks - most clearly in the first weeks of the conflict when nimble Ukrainian infantry destroyed many huge Russian armoured columns with shoulder-launched rockets.""In the old days, it was all about tanks. Now it´s about these new rocket systems,"" said Volodymr. But the coming months could yet see Western tanks - if deployed quickly, and in large numbers - play a decisive role.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storySatellite images show Soledar devastation12 JanuaryDefying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´4 JanuaryWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?4 days agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Rescue efforts are continuing.Several others are still missing and 75 survivors were injured.There is ""minimal"" chance of finding others alive, Mayor Borys Filatov said.On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin´s spokesman insisted that the Russian military did not strike at residential buildings. ""Attacks are made on military targets, either obvious or disguised,"" Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Ukraine said the building was hit by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which it does not have the capability to shoot down. The missile is also known to be extremely inaccurate, according to the office of Ukraine´s prosecutor general. But Mr Peskov suggested the strike on the building could have been the result of Ukrainian air defence. Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa were also hit on Saturday in attacks which Moscow said were targeted at Ukraine´s military and energy infrastructure.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the missile strikes ""inhuman"", adding that ""Russia intentionally keeps on committing war crimes against civilians"". Image source, STR/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, Rescue teams work in the rubble of the damaged residential building hit by shelling in DniproPresident Putin said ""everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff"".Belarus, on Ukraine´s northern border, is beginning joint air force drills with Russia on Monday. The Belarusian defence ministry insists they will be defensive, but there are concerns that Moscow is pressuring Minsk to join the war in Ukraine. Belarus was one of Russia´s launchpads for the invasion last February. In his evening address on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted he had received many messages of sympathy from around the world and condemned the Russian people´s ""cowardly silence"" over the Dnipro attack.Switching to Russian during his message, he said he wanted to address those ""who even now could not utter a few words of condemnation of this terror"".""Your cowardly silence, your attempt to ´wait out´ what is happening, will only end with the fact that one day these same terrorists will come for you."" He added the victims of the strike included a 15-year-old girl and that two children had been left orphans. It has been two weeks since the last wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s power grid. On Saturday, Mr Zelensky said energy infrastructure in the Kharkiv and Kyiv regions had been badly hit.Following the attacks, Ukrainian state energy company Ukrenergo temporarily imposed round-the-clock consumption limits for all regions. Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the next few days would be ""difficult"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Aftermath of missile strike in DniproNato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday that Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from Western countries. ""Recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important - and I expect more in the near future,"" Mr Stoltenberg told German media.Russia´s missile barrage came on the same day that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his government would give Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv´s armed forces in a bid to help ""push Russian troops back"". In response, Moscow said providing more weapons to Ukraine would lead to intensified Russian operations and more civilian casualties.Asked about the supply of British tanks to Ukraine, Mr Peskov replied: ""These tanks are burning and will burn just like the rest.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyRussia fires new waves of missiles across Ukraine15 JanuaryUK to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, PM says15 JanuaryRussia claims victory in bloody battle for Soledar13 JanuaryUkraine defence minister: We are in effect part of Nato13 JanuaryTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But he said the deficit scheme Mr Jackson had outlined would force taxpayers to foot the bill over the next decade.""The government simply needs to step in and pick up this cost like it did in the pandemic,"" he said.""We need £40bn to get through this winter. That´s 10% of what was spent during the pandemic and that´s the only thing that will really sort this problem out.""This summer has seen forecasts, suggestions and a lot of political debate. What it has not seen is certainty.On Friday, households will finally be told exactly by how much domestic energy bills will rise in October. Remember, individual bills will vary, depending on how much gas and electricity you use. But the percentage increase in the domestic energy price cap for England, Wales and Scotland will be official and expressed in clear terms.Energy will be more expensive, but at least people will have some basis to plan for the financial hit.That said, the uncertainty won´t be over. What extra support, if any, that is provided by government won´t be clear until a new prime minister is in place. Energy prices for the second half of the winter are also unclear.Energy bosses say fundamental change in the sector doesn´t come quickly, but help for householders facing soaring bills as the nights draw in cannot come quickly enough.Meanwhile Bill Bullen, founder and chief executive of energy supplier Utilita,said that energy prices must be frozen at their current level.""That´s not going to be enough even still for those customers who are on low incomes and vulnerable, maybe have some medical dependencies so some extra help is going to be required,"" he said. He added: ""The reality is when you get up to £3,500 a huge number of homes won´t be able to afford this.""Mr Vince said there needed to be an overhaul of how electricity prices were decided.""The price of gas sets the price of electricity in our country and we should break that link - other European countries are looking to do exactly that,"" he said.""We let global commodity markets set the price that we pay for gas from our own North Sea and we are paying up to 10 times more for that right now.""He added: ""Half of the gas that Britain uses come from our North Sea if we price cap that we take away half the problem.""Related TopicsEnergy service companiesMore on this storyPlans to cut energy bills if peak-time use avoided22 August 2022Who can get the latest cost-of-living payments?10 JanuaryWhat is the energy price cap and what will happen to my bills?2 hours agoTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished33 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

This was the second time Russia had dropped a missile on their apartment building. In late April, a Radio Liberty journalist was killed in the same building. Ukrainian authorities said the incident showed Russia’s indiscriminate bombing was even targeting their own citizens. The BBC’s Anastassiya Zlatopolskai has tracked down the family in Kyiv who say the attack was unforgivable.

We now have other tasks,"" he said.From Monday onwards, Russia unleashed a wave of strikes on cities across Ukraine, in what Mr Putin said was retaliation for a blast which damaged a key bridge between Russia and annexed Crimea.Dozens of people were killed and injured in the strikes, which also damaged infrastructure. Central areas of Kyiv were targeted for the first time since the invasion.But Mr Putin said it was not Russia´s intention to destroy Ukraine, but he did not regret the invasion.""What is happening today is not pleasant, to put things mildly,"" he said. ""But all the same, [if Russia hadn´t attacked] we would have been in the same situation, only the conditions would have been worse for us. So we´re doing everything correctly and at the right time.""President Putin said 220,000 men had been mobilised, of whom 16,000 were already in combat. He saw no need for additional mobilisation, he added.However, the call-up has caused widespread discontent in Russia, with tens of thousands of men fleeing to neighbouring countries. The BBC has also found evidence of the poor level of training such conscripts or recruits receive before being sent to the front.Meanwhile, the BBC Russian service says it has identified more than 7,500 Russian service personnel who have died in the Ukraine war. The actual level of casualties is believed to be much higher, and there are reports that some recently mobilised troops have been killed.What does Russia´s troop call-up mean for Ukraine?Who is Putin´s hard-line new commander in Ukraine?Ukraine in maps: Where have Russia´s missiles hit?Addressing relations with other former Soviet countries, Mr Putin insisted that the war had not affected their ""character and depth"".He said it was natural for some countries to be concerned but he was keeping them informed in detail.But analysts say Russia´s influence in the region is declining, with leaders like Kazakhstan´s Kassym-Jomart Tokayev trying to distance themselves from Mr Putin over the war.In other developments on Friday:The Russian government says a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia, damaged in a blast last Saturday, must be repaired by July next yearUkrainian officials are urging the Red Cross to visit the notorious Olenivka prison in the Russian-occupied east of the country within three daysElon Musk has said his rocket company SpaceX cannot continue indefinitely to fund the Starlink internet service in Ukraine - now seen as vital to the country´s communications infrastructure - amid reports he has asked the US defence department to do soTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed a Russian proposal to set up a gas hub in Turkey for supplies to EuropeA UK intelligence report says Russian forces from the private military company Wagner Group have captured two villages in Donetsk region, in their first successful advance in the area for three monthsRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaAstanaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyDamaged Crimea bridge ´to take months to repair´14 October 2022What does Russia´s troop call-up mean for Ukraine?21 September 2022Who is Putin´s hard-line new commander in Ukraine?12 October 2022Ukraine in maps: Russian defeat in the south14 November 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

He is the chief executive officer of G-Mak, a Ukrainian-based home security company. His idea is similar to Amazon Ring´s home security system - but on steroids. His company has designed what looks like a small, black box fitted with a camera. If it detects an intruder it can fire out tear gas to put off any would-be burglar. ""Ukrainians know how to defend"" is the company´s wry slogan. However, the war has created a huge problem for him. The workforce he had has been decimated. ""We have lost five people,"" he says, holding back tears. Trying to create a successful start-up at the best of times is a huge challenge but doing so at a time of war is punishingly difficult. Bombing, the targeting of infrastructure and blackouts are just a few of the challenges of working in Ukraine right now. And yet a delegation of Ukrainian start-ups have made the long journey to Las Vegas, to the world´s biggest tech gathering. For them CES (The Consumer Electronics Show) is a huge opportunity to meet Western investors. Just getting to the show has been tough. Image caption, Artem Dudinskyi, co-founder of Corner""It took me three days to get here,"" says Artem Didinskyi, the co-founder of online kitchen designer Corner.Ukrainian men under 60 are not allowed to leave the country, so he has had to obtain special permission from Ukrainian authorities to attend.For him, the countless neon signs of Las Vegas are a far cry from working in Kyiv - where electricity is a luxury. ""Sometimes my working day is limited to the battery of my computer… two weeks ago I didn´t have any electricity for three days,"" he says. Artem has found a solution of sorts though. His local gas station has a reliable generator. His office is now a petrol pump forecourt. It is the only way the programmer can work. He says he has no heating in his apartment. ""I sleep with my dog in my bed to help keep me warm,"" he says. Image caption, Mariana Romaniak, RekavaMariana Romaniak works for Rekava - a company that makes cutlery out of old coffee beans. Based near the Russian border, in the town of Sumy (near Kharkiv), her business partner made the difficult decision of moving the company across Ukraine - some 800km (500 miles) - to the city of Lviv. ""It´s very hard now if you´re a business in Ukraine,"" she says. On top of bombs and electricity shortages Mariana also says it is almost impossible for new companies to get funding ""All of our big investors and big companies are supporting the army,"" she says. It is not all bad news for her company though. Mariana says being in Lviv - close to the border with Poland - has actually helped business. ""We started to think that maybe it´s better for us to be near the European Union - because we can deliver more easily,"" she says. Another company, eFarm, is set up to help Ukrainian farmers utilise fertiliser on their fields by using satellite technology. The company has pivoted in the last few months though - and is trialling tech that can spot land mines. Image caption, Tatiana Gorzey, eFarmTatiana Gorzey from eFarm says 30% of Ukrainian fields have been contaminated. ""If the fields are millions of acres, it´s really difficult to check every inch."" As for Lyubomyr, CEO of G-Mak, he is looking to try to produce his home security units in America. For him, CES is a vital chance to meet potential investors. Many of the delegation put a brave face on the war, and hope they can succeed. And if they can, after all the challenges that the war has thrown at them, they have a pretty good shot at succeeding elsewhere too.

We are continually reviewing our advertising to ensure we´re being sensitive to the current situation.""Orlov does, however, hail from a fictional Russian town and subsequently moved to a London mansion, according to the firm´s owner, Peterborough-based financial company BGL.The meerkat ads have been running since 2009, and have been so successful that Orlov´s ""simples"" catchphrase was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2019. The characters have spawned spin-off cuddly toys, sent as promotions to people who used the price comparison site.Comparethemarket´s move underlines how the Ukraine war has put a focus on companies with Russia links, no matter how remote. There has been a social media campaign for UK supermarkets to show their support by renaming chicken kievs ""chicken kyivs"", using the preferred Ukrainian spelling of its capital.And an American restaurant chain, Applebees, apologised and pulled light-hearted ads when they appeared alongside footage of the invasion.The meerkat campaign was first created by the advertising agency VCCP in London. It was voted the nation´s favourite TV advert in 2016, after a Marketing magazine poll. A memoir for the fictional character Aleksandr Orlov, entitled ""A Simples Life"" reached Amazon´s 100 bestselling books in 2010. With book royalties, the fictional character said he planned to re-marble the meerkat mansion´s roof. The character has 55,800 followers on Twitter.Related TopicsAdvertisingInsuranceMore on this storyUK citizens are advised not to travel to Russia28 February 2022Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps28 February 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

But now the arms traffic is very much in the other direction, writes Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter.Iranian-supplied drones are being used by Moscow to terrorise Ukrainian civilians and to strike at the country´s electricity generating and distribution system. Russia´s predicament in Ukraine has prompted Moscow to turn to Tehran for stocks of precision-guided weapons. Its own arsenals are fast running out. There have been a number of instances where coastal defence and air defence missiles have been used by the Russians to strike at land targets in Ukraine - a role for which they are not best suited. Transport flights have been monitored heading from Iran to Russia. Reports from US sources suggest that Iranian trainers from the IRGC - the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps - have deployed to a base in Crimea to teach Russian personnel how to operate the systems. Wreckage from drones that have been shot down - both Iranian Shahed-131 loitering munitions (colloquially known as kamikaze drones) and the larger Shahed-136 - has been analysed. There is no doubt that Tehran, despite its denials, is compensating for a significant shortfall in Russia´s arsenal.  What is Russia´s ´kamikaze´ drone?This is clearly not good news for Ukraine. While a significant number of the Iranian-supplied drones have been shot down there could be worse to come. Iran has more capable loitering munitions in its arsenal. And there are fears that even more dangerous Iranian weapons - ballistic missiles - could soon be on their way to Russia. These carry much larger warheads than the drones and Ukraine´s anti-ballistic missile capability is limited. This could add a new level of complexity to Western efforts to bolster Ukraine´s anti-air and anti-missile defences. New tensionsBut what of the wider ramifications of this deepening relationship between Moscow and Tehran? There could be implications for the future of the moribund nuclear agreement between the international community and Tehran. Furthermore the delicate balance of forces in Syria could be altered with significant consequences for Israel and, in turn, for its relationship with Moscow.  Clearly both Russia and Iran need friends. They are both isolated and embattled. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Wreckage of a Shahed-136 (or Geranium-2) kamikaze drone shot down by UkrainiansRussia is facing economic sanctions due to its aggression against Ukraine, a war which is not going well for Moscow. Iran´s regime is also under sanction for its nuclear programme and human rights record, and it is facing massive discontent at home. They are both part of a small ""club"" of authoritarian nations, along with China, that seek not just to pursue their own regional strategic goals but also, more broadly, to strike back against what they see as a US-dominated global order.Iran´s security clamp-down at home has already drawn additional economic sanctions from the West. Now its weapons transfers to Russia are being seen by the United Kingdom and France as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 2231 that was passed in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal. This could potentially lead to some nuclear-related sanctions being restored. These new tensions will further undermine efforts to return to the JCPOA, the international deal designed to constrain Iran´s nuclear activities which was abandoned by the Trump Administration in May 2018. Efforts to restore the deal have lapsed at least until after the US Mid-Term elections on 8 November. Meanwhile Iran has continued to make progress in its enrichment activities. The Iran nuclear dossier is a looming shadow for the West as its focus is firmly fixed upon Ukraine. Russia - one of the key parties to the original deal - is hardly going to pressure its new arms supplier to give ground. Syria factorNonetheless, the relationship between Moscow and Tehran is driven by circumstance rather than any deep ideological bond.Russia´s relationship with Iran has long had a measure of ambivalence; a good example is their differing ambitions in Syria. Russia´s military intervention saved the Assad regime. Iranian manpower, weaponry and militias were also crucial to his survival. But Russia, which still maintains a presence in Syria, has never been enthusiastic about Tehran´s regional ambitions there. However it has not acted to contain Iranian influence in quite the way Israel would have wished. That said, it has done little to thwart Israeli air strikes aimed at reversing Iran´s build-up in Syria.Israel’s tricky balancing act over UkraineCould the new dynamic in Russia-Iranian relations change this? While some Russian air defences and troops have been removed from Syria Moscow still has the capacity to interfere with Israeli operations. This has been one of the guiding concerns influencing Israel´s tentative support for Ukraine. But what of the future? Suppose for example that Russia decided to transfer even more advanced weaponry to Iran in return for its assistance, what then? Might this prompt a shift in Israel´s attitude to Kyiv? That for now, with an Israeli general election looming, seems unlikely. But the new Russia-Iran relationship has the potential to impact global affairs way beyond the war in Ukraine.

Russia´s media carried a statement purported to be by the Wagner head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who said Ukrainians were now encircled in the city centre.Ukraine´s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar earlier said that ""heavy fighting is continuing"".The claims by both sides have not been independently verified.In the reported statement late on Tuesday, Mr Prigozhin said: ""Wagner units took control of the entire territory of Soledar. A cauldron has been formed in the centre of the city in which urban fighting is going on.""The statement stressed that only Wagner fighters - who are not part of the Russian armed forces - were taking part ""in the storming"" of Soledar.Meanwhile, Ms Maliar said a few hours before that ""the enemy does not pay attention to the large losses of its personnel and continues to actively storm"". ""The approaches to our positions are simply strewn with the bodies of dead enemy fighters. Our fighters are defending bravely,"" she added.The fall of Soledar - a small salt-mining town in the Donetsk region - could help Russian troops to encircle the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut.The UK said earlier on Tuesday that Russian troops and the mercenary Wagner Group were ""likely"" to now be in control of the town.On Monday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was ""almost no life"" left in Soledar and ""no whole walls left"". ""This is what madness looks like,"" he added. And in a new address late on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky praised the resilience of Ukrainian forces.The strategic importance of Soledar is debated, but its capture would be significant for two reasons.First, it would allow Russian forces to inch closer to the regional city of Bakhmut. Russia could use access to Soledar´s deep, city-like network of salt mine tunnels, dormant since April, to penetrate Ukrainian-controlled territory.Secondly, invading forces would be able to give Ukraine a taste of its own medicine. One thing that has helped Kyiv liberate territory has been its ability to target Russian supply lines. Long-range missile strikes have often left thousands of invading troops unable to replenish personnel, ammunition, fuel, and rations, and stopped them freely moving military hardware.The capturing of Soledar - which had a population of 10,000 before the war - would effectively cut Bakhmut off from a major supply line from nearby Sloviansk. Defying Russia in the city ´at end of the world´Five ways Ukraine war could go in 2023The UK said it believed Soledar was close to falling to Russia - but added that the Kremlin was ""unlikely"" to take Bakhmut immediately due to Ukraine´s ""stable defence lines"".A senior military official from the US Department of Defense said earlier on Monday there was a ""good portion"" of Soledar in Russian hands.Fighting around Bakhmut has been going on for months, and the US official described the most recent exchanges as ""savage"". Two British nationals have gone missing in the region and were last seen heading to Soledar. Image source, Chris Parry/Family of Andrew BagshawImage caption, UK nationals Andrew Bagshaw (L) and Christopher Parry (R) were doing voluntary work, police said, but have not been heard of since FridayDespite the long and intense battle, Oleh Zhdanov - a highly respected military analyst in Ukraine - believes that neither Soledar nor Bakhmut are especially important from an operational point of view. Mr Zhdanov said in an interview on Monday with the Ukrainian newspaper Gazeta that Russia ""is trying to prove to the whole world that its army is capable of winning"". The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think-tank, has said that Mr Prigozhin, ""will continue to use both confirmed and fabricated Wagner Group success in Soledar and Bakhmut to promote the Wagner Group as the only Russian force in Ukraine capable of securing tangible gains"".Russia has suffered several major setbacks in Ukraine since its invasion nearly a year ago, including losing control of the only regional capital in the south it had managed to capture.Capturing Soledar would just as much be a propaganda victory for the Kremlin as a military one. The gains for Russia are relatively small and costly, but the town would be a much-needed trophy to present to critics back home.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineMore on this storyUkraine denies Russian claim it killed 600 soldiers8 JanuaryRussians accused of opening fire despite Putin truce6 JanuaryZelensky visits front-line city of Bakhmut20 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

We´ve always seen Ukrainians as a brotherly people and I still think so. ""What´s happening now is a tragedy, but it´s not our fault.""Russia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones in a wave of strikes on Ukraine´s power infrastructure which began on 10 October.The attacks have plunged millions into darkness.Image source, EPAImage caption, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu proposed beefing up the armed forcesMilitary officials vowed to continue the ""special military operation"" into 2023.When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February, President Putin promised only professional soldiers would take part.But by September that had all changed as he announced a ""partial mobilisation"", potentially drafting hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens into the armed forces.Now, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has proposed raising the age range for mandatory Russian military service.Under the current law, Russians aged 18-27 can be called up for mandatory military service - Mr Shoigu is now proposing this covers citizens aged 21-30.Mr Shoigu also announced plans to establish bases in two port cities - Berdyansk and Mariupol - seized during the Russian offensive.But, in recent months Ukrainian forces have made a series of major advances, including retaking Kherson - the only regional capital captured by Russian forces since the invasion.The address came as Ukrainian leader Volodmyr Zelensky arrived in Washington for his first visit outside of Ukraine since Russia invaded 10 months ago.Biden tells Zelensky Ukraine will never stand alone     Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineMore on this storyIce soldiers mark Russia´s very patriotic Christmas20 December 2022Zelensky heads to US for first trip since war began21 December 2022Ukraine tightens border defence20 December 2022View commentsTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Was he coerced?"" asked Muzang´alu Nyirenda.The family felt ""robbed"" by her brother´s death, she added.Zambia´s Foreign Affairs Minister Stanley Kakubo announced on Monday that Mr Nyirenda, who had been studying at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, was serving a nine-year prison sentence for a drug offence.He said Mr Nyirenda was killed on the front lines in September, but Russian authorities had only just informed Zambia of the death.  Mr Kakubo said that Zambia had demanded answers over the student´s death and why he had been sent to Ukraine. Most Zambians are shocked by the news, but also frustrated that the government has not shared more information to explain the circumstances that led to the student being deployed to Ukraine. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The war in Ukraine is said to have claimed tens of thousands of livesAccording to Ms Nyirenda, her brother travelled to Russia in 2019 to study nuclear engineering on a government sponsorship, a partnership between the two countries which dates back many years. ""There is so much we don´t know. Why didn´t the Zambian government know he was being sent to war to fight?"" his older sister told the BBC.""The people that took him to that war looked down on us as a family, he was nothing to them. They used him,"" she said.The drugs arrestMr Nyirenda was working as a part-time courier when he was arrested in 2020 with a parcel containing drugs, his sister said. ""We believe he didn´t know what was in the package he delivered, he told us he didn´t. He would get text messages for pick-ups and instructions on where to deliver them,"" she said. ""On one occasion he was stopped by the police and searched and they found drugs in the package. He explained he was working for an online courier and didn´t know about the parcels but he was arrested,"" Ms Nyirenda said.The family, however, always remained hopeful that he would return home safely.  But while he was serving his term at a medium security prison he was recruited, his family believe, by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group that has been conscripting prisoners to fight for Russia in Ukraine in exchange for their freedom.In September, leaked footage showed Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group, outlining the rules of fighting, such as no deserting or sexual contact with Ukrainian women, and then giving the prisoners five minutes to decide if they want to sign up.Ominously, he told the prisoners he would get them out of jail alive but said he could not promise to bring them back alive.They have stolen my brotherBorn to university professionals Edwin and Florence Nyirenda, Lemekhani was the youngest of four children. Even while in prison he found a way to communicate with his loved-ones in Zambia.The last time his parents heard from him was on 31 August on a cryptic phone call that filled them with concern.""He told my parents: ´I am no longer in prison but where I am is confidential´. My parents were worried, we all were when he shared this. We knew he was a prisoner in a foreign country where he had no rights, we were worried about what was going on, but he could not share more and my parents didn´t probe him further,"" Ms Nyirenda said. The family notified the Zambian authorities of the odd call and were assured of an investigation into his whereabouts, but months later came the news of the young man´s death.""He was young, they stole his life away from him. He´s got a twin brother, they´ve stolen my brother´s other half,"" his sister said through tears.""Lemekhani had so many plans. He was studying so he could come back and pamper my mother. He had plans to help rebuild Zambia. They´ve robbed us,"" she said. ""There is no closure, only questions. We want him home so we can lay him to rest in peace. We want him back with the people who love him but we deserve answers,"" said Ms Nyirenda.His body, according to Zambian officials, has been transported to Russia´s southern border town of Rostov in preparation for his repatriation to Lusaka where his family will bury him. Further inquiries by the BBC to Zambia´s ministry of foreign affairs have gone unanswered. Zambia has taken a neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine war, like many other African countries, but says it condemns any form of war.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warZambiaRussiaUkraineMore on this storyWagner boss: It´s prisoners fighting, or your children16 September 2022Africa is a hostage of Russia´s war, Zelensky says20 June 2022Around the BBCAfrica Today podcastTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Space, or the complete lack of it, is now the constant constraint in her life.The 19-year-old is living in one single room with her boyfriend and his mother. Not only this, they´re all sharing the same bed. ""I hate it,"" she says. ""I just want some personal space.""Earlier this year, Sofia Prosyanyk fled Mariupol; the city besieged and eventually captured by Russia in May.She met her boyfriend Yaroslav Moiseenko at an evacuation centre, before coming to live with him and his mother Nadiia in the village of Kalynivka, west of the capital Kyiv.But Yaroslav and Nadiia returned to find their own home in ruins, destroyed during the failed Russian march on Kyiv at the start of the war.Now they all live in an out-house that used to be the family´s ""summer kitchen"". The floorspace in the room can be crossed in three strides. The bed and a fridge are on one side while a stove sits right by the door. In between is a stool which they sit on for when they wash. Sixty-three-year-old Nadiia shows me how they lay down a plastic sheet to stop the floor getting wet.Image caption, Sofia and Nadiia´s cramped homeThey say that what´s even worse is that sometimes they have to go to the toilet in here if it´s too cold to use the outdoor bathroom. ""I hate to do that in front of everyone,"" says Sofia.She now only feels ""normal"" when she´s at work at a local petrol station, where there´s a proper toilet and power. While we talk the lights go out which, she says, happens all the time. Millions of Ukrainians have been experiencing power cuts after repeated Russian strikes on the country´s energy grid. Nadiia says they use torches and candles but it´s the suffocating lack of space that is the hardest thing for this family. At least in the summer they could open the door, but now it´s too cold.For Nadiia, the remains of her old house are right next door.We crunch through the snow which covers the foundations of what used to be the ground floor rooms that made up her former home. Her family had started building it when she was just 14 years old.Image caption, Sofia Prosyanyk and Nadiia MoiseenkoNow about to turn 64, Nadiia describes herself as ""homeless"" and cries as she explains how hard it is to let go of her memories when they lie, right there, amidst the rubble.""When I want to go and take something, I keep remembering where all the things were in my old house,"" she says.""There was a closet near the wall. Now when I want to take something from there, I catch myself thinking - there is nothing there anymore.""Coming home after the Russians had left their village, Kalynivka west of Kyiv, should have been a joy for Nadiia but instead it´s a source of constant grief.They hope that soon, via a charity called Nest, they will get a pre-fabricated house where Sofia could live with Yaroslav, while Nadiia would stay in the out-building.We trundle along snow-covered tracks to another part of a village where men are busy putting up one of those prefab homes for 64-year-old Inna and her son.   She comes out to greet us but almost immediately bursts into tears, recalling those early weeks of the war.""Everything was on fire,"" she tells me. ""Shells flew right above our heads.""Image caption, Inna crying outside her home in KalynivkaThey left their home in March and returned in May, building a make-shift place to live on the site of where their old house had stood.We go inside and it´s clear why Inna´s been prioritised for a pre-fab home as soon as possible.The roof, such as it is, drips constantly onto a wet and dirty floor, while the kitchen is freezing cold. Inna often wrings her hands because of the pain of her swollen joints. We crouch through another door into a dark back room and suddenly, it´s stiflingly hot.Socks and clothes hang from a washing line along the ceiling.At least it´s warm in this part of the hastily-constructed home, but it´s an unhealthy and oppressive heat coming from an old wood-burning stove.The whole situation is taking its toll on Inna´s health but she expresses a resilience that you hear from so many in Ukraine.""We will get through everything,"" she says.Her hope is that Ukraine can win the war, ""as soon as possible"".""So that there is peace and tranquillity. So that all soldiers return home alive and well. This is the main thing. The lack of light is not scary, we will survive.""Ukraine War: The basicsINSIDE THE WAR: The surrender hotline for Russian soldiersEXPLAINER: How much damage has Russia done to power supplies?ANALYSIS: The slim prospects for peace talksON THE GROUND: Facing a harsh winter on the front lineRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaUkraineMore on this story´In war, you don´t get accidentally killed - you accidentally survive´25 November 2022´The Russians are gone but I still live in cellar´19 November 2022Widower recalls day wife was killed in Ukraine war11 November 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The enemy has thrown its strongest assault at Bakhmut. We haven´t seen troops like this before,"" the Ukrainian commander tells us.Commander Skala, as he wants to be called, is controlling the Ukrainian operation to defend the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region from an underground chamber off a nondescript street. It is one of the main command centres the Ukrainian military has set up in the city, and few journalists have been here.A tall, hefty man with sparkling eyes, he watches a live feed from a drone hovering outside the eastern edge of the city on a big screen in the centre of the room.One of the battalion´s units is trying to spot the location of Russian positions, to aid another unit which has just gone out to defend eastern approaches to Bakhmut under attack.In addition to Russian armed forces, mercenaries from the private paramilitary Wagner group have been sent in their thousands to front lines around Bakhmut. Image caption, Commander Skala is operating from an underground command centre in Bakhmut""Wagner soldiers openly advance under fire towards us even if they´re littering the land with their bodies, even if out of 60 people in their platoon only 20 are left. It´s very difficult to hold against such an invasion. We weren´t prepared for that, and we´re learning now,"" Commander Skala says.""Some weeks ago, we lost positions on the eastern approaches to the city because the enemy was constantly storming us with assaults. We moved to secondary front lines to save our soldiers,"" he adds.""We are trying to work smartly and get those positions back. Sometimes you have to withdraw to attack the enemy properly.""Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has said Ukrainians have turned every house in Bakhmut into a fortress, and that there were now ""500 lines of defence"".Russia has been using all its might to try to take Bakhmut - a battle considered critical for the country after it lost ground in Ukraine in recent months, being pushed out of Kherson in the south and the Kharkiv region in the north-east. Capturing Bakhmut is also important to further Russia´s aim to control the whole of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.Image caption, Bombs have ripped through facades of buildings everywhere in BakhmutThroughout our conversation with Commander Skala, muffled explosions can be heard from above ground. The second you step outside, the sound is loud enough to make your heart pound - the terrifying whistle of shells flying in followed by the deafening boom of the impact. And the sound never stops as the bombs keep falling.One resident described it as ""the end of the world"" and there are moments when it feels like that. Bombs have ripped through the middle of apartment blocks, blown away the facades of buildings and created craters by the side of streets. It was hard to find a window in Bakhmut that was intact. The ground is littered with broken glass and debris. This was once a quiet, ordinary town in the east, known for its sparkling wine. Now, it´s become a byword for war and Ukraine´s resistance. It lies at a vital road intersection, but over the months, the battle here has gained a symbolic importance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently called it the ""fortress of our morale"".Bakhmut used to be home to just over 70,000 people before the war. Just a tenth of its residents - mostly elderly or poor - remain.While the streets are largely empty, we see dozens of civilians in an aid centre, known here as a ""resilience centre"".It has power, and wi-fi provided by Elon Musk´s Starlink satellite system. Volunteers distribute small packets of food, medicines and other basic supplies. A wood-burner in the centre keeps the room warm. This is a lifeline for the people in Bakhmut. Image caption, This resilience centre helps those residents still in the city stay warm and charge their phonesMany sit huddled around electrical points, trying to charge up their phones. What´s remarkable is that even when shells land just a few hundred metres from the centre, people don´t flinch. It´s as if they´ve become numb, running from bombs every day. Trauma is visible on many faces though. Why don´t you leave, we asked Anatolay Suschenko, who was standing in a queue for some food. ""I have nowhere to go. I´m alone. Who would want to take an 86-year-old?"" he said. ""Here, at least sometimes when soldiers throw away food or soup, I find it and eat it. And I get free bread. In my whole life, I´ve never seen anything like this. All the windows of my house have been blown off, and the gate has been destroyed.""People have different reasons to stay. Olha Tupikova sits in the corner of the room with her 13-year-old daughter Diana. ""I think everywhere in Ukraine is equally dangerous. Some of our neighbours left and died elsewhere. Here we have a house. We have cats and dogs. We can´t leave them,"" she said. ""Our roof has 21 holes and the garage has nine. I mend them every time, and try to repair the windows too. Normally the holes are caused by shrapnel, but lately we´ve had stones flying in too, making holes that are the size of a head.""Image caption, Olha (left) and her daughter Diana, are staying in Bakhmut as they have a house and cats and dogs""We live like mice. We quickly run out to get some bread, choose different routes to get back home. Before sunrise I look for wooden boards and logs [to repair my home]. In the evening I search for water because there´s no water supply in town,"" Olha said. ""Of course, it´s frightening. But now we do it army style, like soldiers. We joke that master chefs know nothing about cooking [compared to us]. We can make a meal out of anything on an open fire, or even a candle.""The local administration is trying to convince people to leave. In a location in the city we can´t disclose because it could compromise his safety, we met Oleksiy Reva, who has been the mayor of Bakhmut for 33 years. ""It´s those who don´t have money and don´t want to face the unknown who are staying. But we are talking to them about it. Because safety is most important, safety and peace,"" he said.Why does he continue to stay, we asked. ""This is my life, my job, my fate. I was born here, and grew up here. My parents are buried here. My conscience won´t allow me to leave our people. And I´m confident our military will not allow Bakhmut to fall,"" he said.In the fields outside the city, we see the daily grind required to keep a hold on it. The unit of soldiers we meet try to spot Russian locations and fire artillery - Soviet-era D-30 guns - in their direction, to allow Ukrainian infantry to push ahead every day. But barely any advance is being made.""The equipment is outdated. It works fine and does the job, but it can be better. We also have to be very economical with our shells, very precise with our targets so we don´t run out of ammunition. If we had more equipment and modern weapons, we would be able to destroy more targets which would make things much easier for our infantry,"" one of the soldiers, Valentyn, said.Winter also makes things difficult. Weapons don´t operate as smoothly in cold weather, they tell us.Image caption, Ukrainian forces say their weapons are outdated and they worry about running out of ammunition""We simply need to overcome this period, hold on, and then execute counter-offensives and fight,"" Yaroslav said.Each side is trying to wear the other down. This is a battle of endurance.How do you motivate yourself every day, we asked. ""We all have families to go back to. Valentyn just had a son but his family is in Germany, so he hasn´t seen him yet,"" Yaroslav said as Valentyn cracked a shy smile. ""His motivation is colossal.""Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Mariana Matveichuk, Sanjay Ganguly and Daria Sipigina.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineUkrainian refugeesMore on this storyFive ways Ukraine war could go in 202327 December 2022My nights are peaceful at last, after air raids trauma in Ukraine26 December 2022The making of a young Hero of Ukraine22 December 2022Top StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesAre K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend?The airman fighting Ukraine´s war in the skyDesigning for Beyoncé and Sam Smith from UkraineHow tech is being used to take on ocean plasticAdam Lambert: ´I didn´t think I´d have a shot´Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalThe mysterious 3,700-year-old sentence finally decodedPower, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynastyLiving with trauma after surviving the Turkey quakesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

He then announced that Minsk and Moscow were forming a joint ""regional group"" of forces for protection.Mr Sakhashchyk puts the risk of the two countries opening a northern front in Ukraine as one in three, currently. But he describes the long-time leader of Belarus as a ""wily"" operator.""Lukashenko will do everything possible not to send his troops to fight, to limit them to a supporting role, but there is certainly a threat."" Belarus is already heavily involved in the Ukraine war.In February, Russian tanks crossed its southern border towards Kyiv and Russia regularly launches missiles from Belarusian territory. The EU is currently preparing another punishment package of sanctions in response. But if President Putin is pushing him for more, Mr Lukashenko has limited room for manoeuvre.The authoritarian leader has been dependent on Russia since 2020, when support from Moscow helped him survive an unprecedented wave of protests.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Massive protests against Lukashenko in 2020 sparked a brutal crackdown by the regimeMeanwhile, the mass imprisonment and torture of protestors hammered one nail in the coffin of relations with the West. Belarus aiding Russia´s invasion was another. Mr Lukashenko says up to 9,000 Russian soldiers will come to Belarus for the new group. But sending Belarusians alongside them into Ukraine would be a deeply unpopular move.Several hundred Belarusians are already fighting in Ukraine - against Russia. Known as the Kalinovsky regiment, they openly say they joined the war to defeat Vladimir Putin so that Belarus, too, can be free.  There is also resistance inside Belarus where partisans sabotaged railway lines at the start of the invasion to hinder the movement of Russian troops. Last week, another of the group was sentenced to 11 years in prison.""I get lads writing and saying we don´t want to fight [against Ukraine],"" Pavel Kukhta, of the Kalinovsky regiment, told me at their recruitment base in Warsaw.""My sources in the Belarussian army say 90% won´t fight. They say the training´s bad and kit and morale are even worse than the Russian army.""Just a bluff?There have been rumours of a secret mobilisation in Belarus, but nothing substantiated.Meanwhile, Russian forces are already on the move.Ukrainian intelligence reports that 3,200 Russian soldiers have been sent to Belarus to date. More are expected, but it is a trickle not a rush and so far they are heading for northern and central parts of the country, rather than the Ukraine border.""They don´t bring any heavy equipment, there was just one train loaded with pontoon bridges but no tanks or personnel carriers,"" Belarusian journalist Tadeusz Giczan also points out.Belarusian MoD published a few more photos of Russian soldiers arriving at training bases in northern Belarus, making it clear that these are only mobilised reservists.

Belarus offered to provide it and perhaps kill two birds with one stone: threaten Ukraine with a potential new offensive from the north. It´s just a bluff.""The Russian men shown in Belarusian defence ministry videos appear to be ""mobiki"" - recently mobilised reservists, not regular troops. Some have non-military items of kit or clothing. Valery Sakhashchyk agrees they could be training.""They need a lot of instructors and Russia has a problem with that as they´ve lost a lot of men."" The mobiki could then be deployed to the border, but that would be detected.For now, a Belarusian monitoring group sees equipment heading out of the country instead.The Hajun project says more than 90 tanks have been transported to Russia in recent weeks, likely urgently needed replacements for Donbas.It sees no major new build-up of equipment or missiles at the base used by Russia near the Ukraine border.Image caption, As yet analysts don´t see any new build up of forces on Belarus´s border with UkraineWhat if a joint force went in?Some argue that committing Belarusian troops to Ukraine would be pointless, militarily.""They´re not skilled, not equipped and not motivated. They won´t pose a threat,"" opposition politician Franak Viacorka has tweeted.But Valery Sakhashchyk cautions they should not be discounted. The Ukrainian military suggests a new, joint force could try to cut off its supply routes from the West, giving Russian troops a better chance on the battlefield. ""If they mobilised to military level it would be a serious attack force which would be unpleasant for Ukraine. They would have to move significant forces to the north, they would sustain significant losses,"" Mr Sakhashchyk says, though he thinks Belarusian morale would be low.""They would make things harder, make it slower to reach victory - but Ukraine will win."" The video produced by Ukraine´s military fast-cuts images of tanks and missiles with Mr Lukashenko and President Putin and calls on Belarusians not to die for the personal ambitions of two dictators.But Alexander Lukashenko´s desire for power may be just what prevents their deployment.""It would likely be a big catastrophe for the Belarusian army and for Lukashenko himself. So he´ll be trying to talk his way out of this and his negotiating position is still quite strong,"" says journalist Tadeusz Giczan.""He can still convince Putin that the Belarusian army would not add much capacity… in Ukraine, but [the deployment] could backfire pretty badly and destabilise Russia´s only proper ally."" In his battle to stop Ukraine escaping Russia´s grasp for good, Vladimir Putin will not want to risk losing Belarus, too.

Since then Covid restrictions, the political situation between Iran and the US, and the war in Ukraine, have all delayed his progress.Speaking from Mexico, where he has been living for the past two-and-a-half years, Mr Bushby said: ""I have got to start moving again. It´s the most difficult position I´ve been in on this expedition. It feels like I´m treading a wall of friction between the West and the East. I have to find a way through.""With Iran ""out of the question"", Mr Bushby looked to Russia - a country he has previously visited on his walk.""Spring 2022 and the war in Ukraine kicked off,"" said Mr Bushby. ""So now Russia is off limits, too.""Mr Bushby believes the only viable option that remains involves swimming 160 miles (257km) across the Caspian Sea, from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan. Under the rules he set himself prior to beginning the walk, Mr Bushby cannot use any form of transport.""Swimming across the Caspian Sea is now Plan A,"" he said. ""I am looking to do this in summer 2023. I am going to spent the next year getting myself into the right condition.""The Caspian Sea has been swum before but we´re talking a handful of individuals who do this kind of extreme swimming. There are people who do this kind of swimming all the time. I am not one of them.""Mr Bushby said the crossing would probably take ""a month or so"" to complete and would be done in stages.He added: ""After Azerbaijan, I´m into Georgia. At that point, I´m on the home straight.""In March 2006, Mr Bushby and French adventurer Dimitri Kieffer crossed the Bering Strait on foot, trekking across a frozen 56-mile (90km) section in 15 days.While crossing the Russian border near the Chukotkan village of Uelen, the pair were detained by officials for not entering the country at a correct port of entry.  Mr Bushby added: ""I was young and fit then. I´m now 53. Swimming this sort of distance, across the Caspian Sea, is going to take a lot of stamina.""Related TopicsHullRussia-Ukraine warUkraineTop StoriesLive. Final talks on NI post-Brexit deal as UK PM meets EU chief - No 10Published7 hours agoMore than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreckPublished34 minutes agoSettlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killedPublished9 minutes agoloading features storiesElsewhere on the BBCThe iconic outfits that cause outrageWhy Gen Z are feeling stressed at workNZ´s battle with a ruthless predatorMost Read1Opposition wins biggest Nigeria city - provisional2How Russia invaded Ukraine´s south - and got stuck3Belarusian opposition says it damaged Russian warplane4Cocaine worth $330m found in banana shipment5Settlers rampage in West Bank after Israelis killed6Ex-husband charged with murder of Hong Kong model7More than 100 people feared dead in Italy shipwreck8Drug lord on the run ´had Korean face surgery´9Spectacular northern lights seen across UK10Namibia and Iceland caught in jaws of fish scandalBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Lützerath, in western Germany, is on the verge - literally - of being swallowed up by the massive coal mine on its doorstep. Around 200 climate change activists, who are now all that stand in the way of the diggers expanding the Garzweiler opencast mine, have been warned that if they don´t leave by Tuesday they´ll be forcibly evicted. It´s why they´ve taken to the trees, Bente Opitz explains. ""It´s a lot harder for the police to evict us,"" she says. ""We have ropes between the treehouses so we can move from one to another.""Image caption, Bente Opitz is one of 200 activists trying to hold off the minersBut the protesters are busy at ground level too. Young men and women, many with scarves masking their faces, reinforce makeshift barricades and load wheelbarrows with bricks. Scorch marks on the road at the entrance to the village are evidence of a skirmish with police officers last week. The land around and under Lützerath is rich in lignite - the dirtiest form of coal. The mine, a bleak and dull brown man-made canyon which stretches over 35 square kilometres, yields 25 million tonnes of the stuff every year. The energy company RWE, which operates the mine, now owns the village. The residents are all gone, their houses abandoned. Only the protesters remain, squatting in the old brick buildings, watching the mine expand towards them. The battle for Lützerath has been raging for a long time. But Russia´s war on Ukraine has given it a greater significance, transforming it into a national symbol of the struggle within German politics and society; how does a country which relied so heavily on Russian gas, now balance its need for energy with its ambitions on climate change?  Image caption, The energy company owns the village, but the protesters now camp inside the abandoned homesIts government, a three-way coalition which includes Germany´s Green Party, has already had to, as the Germans would say, swallow some toads. Ministers who came to power promising to end reliance on coal have found themselves ordering a number of old coal fired power stations back online or delaying plans to decommission others (including two lignite units run by RWE) to keep the country in electricity while other sources are found.But Lützerath is likely to be the last German village lost to a coal mine. The government has pledged to bring forward its planned phase-out of coal to 2030 in North Rhine-Westphalia, the state in which Garzweiler lies (the national target is 2038).And RWE and the regional government have agreed to limit the extension of the mine; plans to demolish and excavate five other villages have been scrapped. But RWE, which states it´s investing heavily in energy transition technologies both in the region and around the world, claims that, under the current circumstances, Germany needs the lignite under Lützerath.The activists are determined to stop them getting to it. Image source, Bernd Lauter/Getty ImagesImage caption, These activists´ structures were destroyed last week""If they dig for this coal, they´re taking down climate goals, they´re throwing the Paris agreement in the bin,"" says protester Dina Hamid.  RWE insists that´s not the case. ""People are dying now from the climate crisis,"" she adds. ""If we want to save lives, if we don´t want this to keep happening, we need to save every bit of coal, every bit of fossil fuel in the ground.""Dina emphasises that hers will be a peaceful protest although she admits that there are differing views in the camp as to how far their resistance should go. As we speak, more supporters arrive, bearing backpacks, to join the activists, some of whom have lived on the site for more than a year. Police officers, some in riot gear, stand close by, wary, as some of the protesters link arms and form a line just a few metres away from the giant digger bearing down on the village. It´s a striking sight; the officers and the activists preparing for a last stand, all dwarfed by the great mechanical teeth working away at the earth in front of them.

As aid workers stress, these are not people who will be made a bit more comfortable by help from the UN. They are people, particularly children, who will probably die without it.But that appeal was made before Russia invaded Ukraine. Both countries used to sell grain to the WFP. Back then, Ukraine was a supplier, not a country in need of humanitarian assistance, as the WFP´s Geneva director Annalisa Conte points out. Food shortagesIn the first month of the war, the WFP reached a million people inside Ukraine. But its supply of Ukrainian grain, destined to feed some of the hungriest on the planet, has dried up. Meanwhile, many African countries, while not dependent on UN aid, import grain from Ukraine. Somalia gets more than 60% of its grain from Ukraine and Russia, while Eritrea gets nearly 97% of its wheat from Ukraine. They now have to bid against Europeans and North Americans on the international market in search of food. Jan Egeland, former head of UN emergency relief and now with the Norwegian Refugee Council, describes this as a ""catastrophe"" for the poorest parts of the world. ""They will starve,"" he says. Selective aid?This March, in the hope of reminding donors of the continued needs in Yemen and Afghanistan, the UN launched emergency ""flash"" appeals.Image source, WFPImage caption, Malnutrition is on the rise in AfghanistanUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that Afghans were ""selling their children, and their body parts, in order to feed their families"". But the flash appeal for Afghanistan achieved about half of what the UN asked for. A similar appeal for Yemen, which the UN says is the world´s worst humanitarian crisis, got less than a third.What is the World Food Programme?How much aid is getting into Afghanistan?Although aid workers don´t like to say it publicly, there is an uneasy feeling that traditional donor countries in Europe, who in recent weeks have raised record sums for Ukraine and offered tens of thousands of places in their homes for Ukrainian refugees, are being somewhat selective about who they help.There is no question that vulnerable civilians in Ukraine ""deserve all our compassion, and the outpouring of generosity that we have seen"", says Robert Mardini, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross. But, he adds, there is a long list of unresolved conflicts elsewhere that continue to unfold day in, day out.  The crises in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria among others have only got worse since the Ukraine war. Jan Egeland admits aid agencies feel ""overstretched, underfunded, overwhelmed like never before"". Compassion for allThe generosity towards Ukrainians who have fled their homes has been welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency. But aid workers also know that until quite recently, many European countries, among them Hungary and Poland, were pushing Syrian refugees back across their borders.Image source, ReutersImage caption, More than four million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries because of the Russian invasionThe refugee agency´s Shabia Mantoo thinks the Ukraine war could be an opportunity for the world to come to a better understanding of what it is to be a refugee, or to be a neighbouring country, like Lebanon, Uganda or Turkey, hosting hundreds of thousands of people.She hopes the countries now throwing their doors open to Ukrainian refugees will ""extend that solidarity, that compassion to all others in a similar situation"".Tough year aheadBut even if this crisis does cause a surge in global solidarity, aid agencies know this will be a very difficult year. The fact that Russia, a permanent, veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, is the aggressor in this latest war will probably make the delivery of aid more complicated.The UN needs co-operation between Russia and the West, for example, for cross-border deliveries to Syria. But this relationship is now ""in the deep freeze"", as Jan Egeland puts it. Meanwhile, food and fuel prices are set to rise still further, while wealthy countries are looking to balance their books after spending tens of billions on their Covid recovery programmes.It´s a perfect storm, aid workers say, which shows once again that humanitarian aid is never a solution and usually only an inadequate sticking plaster on the gaping wound of war.Peace is the precondition to everything else, says Annalisa Conte.
